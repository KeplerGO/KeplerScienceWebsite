<h3 id="pipeline-overview">Pipeline overview</h3>
<p>Data collected by the Kepler photometer are recorded on orbit, downlinked,
archived, and end up at the Space Science Division of NASA's Ames
Research Center. All science data is processed and calibrated through
the Kepler Science Pipeline. The pipeline converts raw data numbers,
pixel locations, and ancillary engineering data into calibrated counts
and astrometric coordinates. After summing the counts within defined
apertures, estimating and subtracting background light, and adjusting
for cosmic rays, calibrated light curves are created for each selected
source. Further processing corrects these light curves for a variety
of instrumental artifacts and conditions the data for the next step (a
numerical search for candidate planetary transit events in the case of
Kepler data). Kepler candidate transits are then validated in the final processing stage.</p>
<p>Processed data is written to FITS-formatted files and exported to the
<a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/">MAST</a> archive at the Space Telescope
Science Institute. The archived data includes the raw and calibrated
pixel values for all sources, background pixels, calibrated and
corrected light curves, and related ancillary engineering
data. The specific data products and content
archived at MAST are detailed <a href="data-products.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pipeline components</strong></p>
<p>Each processing step is executed via a software module, developed and
implemented by the Science Operations Center (the "SOC") at NASA
Ames. Each module is composed of a number of procedures coded in
Matlab. A global schematic of the pipeline flow is presented
below. The principal elements of the pipeline are entitled (followed
by their common use abbreviations):</p>
<ul>
<li>Calibration   (CAL)</li>
<li>Photometric Analysis   (PA)</li>
<li>Pre-search Data Conditioning   (PDC)</li>
</ul>
<p>For Kepler data only, the pipeline also included the following
elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transiting Planet Search   (TPS)</li>
<li>Data Validation   (DV)</li>
</ul>
<p>A schematic of the Kepler Processing Pipeline is shown below. The
primary software modules are indicated on the left.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="images/pipeline1_drn5.jpg" style="min-width:97%;"/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4 id="calibration-cal">Calibration (CAL)</h4>
<p>The initial step in the Kepler science data pipeline is performed by
the software module termed CAL. CAL converts raw data numbers into
calibrated pixels, which are then passed to the Photometric Analysis (PA)
module for compilation into a light curve. The Science Operations
Center at Ames receives pixel data from the Data
Management Center at STScI.  Data from each Kepler CCD is formatted as
FITS files, including collateral pixel data, collected for
calibration. CAL operates on both the 30 min (long cadence) and 1 min
(short cadence) observations, as well as on the full frame
images. Users of CCD data will be familiar with most functions of the
calibration module, however we note a few aspects peculiar to the
operational modes of Kepler. In general, most users of Kepler or K2
data will not work directly with raw counts, so the information
provided here is to inform users on the the process by which
calibrated pixels are generated.</p>
<p><strong>CAL functions</strong></p>
<p>CAL performs a number of functions familiar to CCD photometrists to
transform raw data counts into calibrated pixels, operating on a
single CCD channel at a time. Detailed models of each CCD were
developed during pre-flight testing, and are combined with full-frame
images obtained during the commissioning period both before and after
ejection of the aperture cover. Each CCD channel consists of 1070 rows
by 1132 columns, of which only a subset (1024 x 1100) is used for
photometry.</p>
<p>Below is a block diagram of a Kepler CCD, showing the science and collateral pixel locations.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="images/CCD_blockdiagram1.jpg" style="min-width:97%;"/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The focal plane CCD models are applied within CAL to execute the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bias level</strong><br/>
The CCD bias level is determined using collateral pixels obained with
each CCD read. Users should note that the term "black level" is used
in much of the Kepler documentation, as a synonym for the more
commonly used "bias level". The bias level contains both a 2D map, and
an additional 1D "dynamic" bias correction. Once the 2D black level is
removed, a fit to the residual bias is used to estimate a 1D black
correction. Note the difference between Kepler's bias subtraction
method, and the approach commonly used for shuttered, non-continuous
CCD operation, in which the user takes separate bias frames, before,
during and after data collection.<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dark current</strong><br/>
Dark current is estimated from the masked and virual smear
pixels. Since the focal plane is maintained at −85 C, the effective
dark current is essentially zero
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...713L..92C">(Caldwell et al. 2010)</a>. <br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smear</strong><br/>
Kepler observes continuously, with no shutter; therefore stars
illuminate the CCDs during readout. This "staring" mode produces
trails along columns that contain stars, as charge is smeared out
during the read. Each pixel in a given column of the image receives
the same smear signal. These values are typically small, since each
pixel only “sees” a star for the readout time, 520 milli-seconds,
divided by the number of rows 1070. The smear level correction in each
image is determined using the masked and virtual smear pixels set
aside for this purpose, as seen in the figure above. <br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gain</strong><br/>
The gain function associates observed photoelectrons (e-) to the
analog/digital units generated by the A/D converter. Gain is the
average slope of the transfer function, and has a median value of 112
e-/ADU across the focal plane <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...713L..92C">(Caldwell et al. 2010)</a>. A measure of the
deviation from the linear transfer function is estimated at each ADU
signal level; this nonlinearity model provides appropriate
corrections. <br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Undershoot</strong><br/>
An issue noted during pre-flight testing can be described as a large,
signal-dependent trailing undershoot in the image, traced to an
amplifier in the local detector electronics. An undershoot model is
applied to correct affected pixels. <br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flat field</strong><br/>
A flat field correction is the last step in CAL, applied to
photometric pixels to correct for spatial variations in pixel
sensitivity to a uniform light source. CAL uses a local flat field,
also termed the pixel response non-uniformity (PRNU) map. The PRNU
image maps each pixel’s relative brightness variation from the local
mean, expressed in percent. The median
standard deviation of the pixel values in the PRNU image across the
focal plane is 0.96%. The flat field was developed during ground
testing prior to launch; there are no separate flat field exposures
obtained on orbit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CAL produces the basic photometric product of Kepler: a series of
calibrated target pixel images within a pre-set aperture. The
photometric time series is constructed from these images in the next
step, Photometric Analysis (PA).</p>
<h4 id="photometric-analysis-pa">Photometric Analysis (PA)</h4>
<p>The PA module constructs a photometric time series, i.e. a light
curve, from the pixels defined to contain the optimal aperture and
associated background pixels. The data are in the form of integrated
(total) photoelectrons collected during either a 1-minute or 30-minute
observation. For each observation, a timestamp is associated, defined
as the modified Julian date at the midpoint of the observation. Each
data point in the time series is the direct sum of the photoelectron
counts within a pre-defined target aperture. Source apertures are constructed to maximize
the signal-to-noise ratio of the light curves and take into account
the varying pixel response function across the focal plane. Details
about the source apertures are provided
<a href="pipeline.html#pixel-response-function">here</a> and in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...713L..97B">Bryson et al. 2010</a>.</p>
<p><strong>PA functions</strong></p>
<p>The tasks performed by PA are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Barycentric time correction</strong><br/>
Timestamps are computed using the onboard clock and a detailed ephemeris of the
spacecraft trajectory. A further correction is applied such that the
mid-cadence timestamp references the time of signal capture at the
solar system barycenter. The barycentric corrections produced in PA
also compensates for the small timing offsets produced by readout of
the array. <br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"Argabrightening" event detection</strong> <br/>
An occasional diffuse illumination of portions of the focal plane lasting a few
minutes was detected. The origin of these brightenings is not
currently known. The software searches for these events, and flags the
affected pixels. Event detection occurs first in the PA module flow,
to ensure that this brightening is not confused with much more
localized excess photoelectrons produced by cosmic rays. Pixels
affected by Argabrightening are "gapped" in the light curve, i.e., set
to -Inf. Listings of the specific affected cadences are presented in
the relevant data release notes for Kepler and K2. <br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cosmic ray cleaning</strong> <br/>
Kepler is affected by the solar and Galactic high energy particle
flux, with an expected rate of ~3 per day per pixel <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...713L.120J">(Jenkins et al.
2010)</a>. Cosmic rays
(CRs) impact at all angles of incidence; each event contributes
charge to ~4 adjacent pixels. In PA, CRs are identified and subtracted
in both background and source pixels, using a robust outlier
identification algorithm. Since CRs are more easily detected in
photometrically quiet sources, mitigation is more effective for those
sources. The user is cautioned that CRs may not be adequately removed
from bright pixels, but the overall effect on light curve precision
will be minimal. The same method and parameters are used for both long
and short cadence observations. PA also logs detected CRs and derived
CR metrics for impact rate and mean deposited energy. <br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Background removal</strong><br/>
A background signal is subtracted from each pixel (before summing) in
the optimal aperture. Since each source aperture does not include
extra pixels to evaluate the local background, Kepler collects a
distinct set of background pixels on each channel for this purpose. A
grid of background apertures are defined on each channel, roughly
symmetric across the focal plane. Each aperture generally contains
four pixels, an 8x8 arcsec square, which are selected to avoid nearby stars and
potentially saturated columns. The integrated diffuse background at
each target pixel location is derived by fitting a 2-D polynomial to
the calibrated background pixels for each cadence, then interpolating
the fit for the specific pixels in the target aperture. <em>No background pixels are collected at 1-minute intervals. For this
data, the long cadence background polynomials are temporally
interpolated to the midpoints of the short cadence intervals. Short
cadence data users should be aware that changes in the background
which occur on timescales less than 30 minutes are not captured by the
current operations mode.</em> Additional information about backgrounds can be found <a href="pipeline.html#backgrounds">here</a>. <br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aperture photometry</strong><br/>
Each source is defined by a target aperture mask and the optimal
photometric aperture. The optimal aperture contains a subset of the
total pixels in the mask. The flux is the unweighted sum of pixels in the optimal aperture after
background removal, termed Simple Aperture Photometry (SAP). This
aperture is defined as the pixel set with the largest derived
signal-to-noise ratio, taking into account the Poisson noise for the
source and background, read noise, and quantization noise. Note that
the optimal aperture does not necessarily capture the total flux from
a source, but for Kepler was specifically designed to minimize noise for maximum transit
detection sensitivity. Also, the PSF wings from surrounding sources will affect photometry in the optimal
aperture. The crowding metric is defined as the fraction of flux in
the optimal aperture produced by the target. This metric was computed
for each target list each quarter for Kepler. The excess flux due to crowding
within the optimal aperture is removed when the light curves are
corrected in the next processing step (PDC). Furthermore, since the spacecraft rolled 90 degrees each quarter during the
Kepler mission, any given Kepler target will lie on a different CCD after each roll. Apertures were
re-defined for each quarter, to account for the different pixel
response functions of the CCDs on which the source may fall.<br/>
<br/>In the currently exported FITS light curve files, the output of
PA is labeled "raw" flux to distinguish it from light curves which
have been corrected for systematic effects in the subsequent PDC
software module. At present, there is no flagging of individual bad
pixels in the aperture photometry, nor does PA exclude known bad
pixels by "gapping" observations. Compromised data is marked on a per
channel and cadence basis, e.g., the Argabrightening events described
above. Individual bad pixels will affect one or more cadence
observations of individual targets; users are cautioned to inspect the
target pixels if they suspect corrupted data is producing an odd light
curve. In general, users may wish to perform custom photometry by altering
the mix of included pixels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Source centroids</strong><br/>
The photocenter of each source is referred to as the source centroid. Flux-weighted centroids are calculated for
all defined sources for each cadence. The derived centroids are tabulated in the light curve file
exported to MAST and provide a centroid motion time series for each
source. <br/>
<br/> The dominant source of long-term source motion for Kepler targets, differential
velocity abberation (DVA), is produced by the spacecraft motion during
each quarter. Each source traces a small elliptical arc across the
detectors over the period of Kepler's orbit. Source motions also may occur due to random pointing jitter, pointing drift, and focus
changes induced by thermal transients. For K2, low-frequency motion due to solar pressure and subsequent thruster firings causes targets to drift across detector pixels. <br/>
<br/>An example of a motion centroid time series for Kepler is shown
below. Motion of the nominal "center" of channel 1 (mod.out 2.1) is displayed for Q0. The large systematic drift is due to
differential velocity abberation. Since this channel is located at the
edge of the FOV, it also exhibits greater sensitivity to focus jitter
and drift. The total amplitude of the centroid motion is on order 0.1
pixels, equivalent to 0.4 arcseconds.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Astrometric solution</strong><br/>
PA performs a standard function of astronomical data pipelines:
assignment of celestial coordinates to detector pixels. On order 200
optimal sources are selected on each channel: bright, unsaturated,
minimally-crowded, main sequence stars. A 2-D polynomial fit is
constructed from the source row and column centroids for each channel
and cadence. Right ascension and declination for each pixel are
interpolated by mapping the polynomial fit to detector locations for a given output channel. The astrometric solution is
derived for each cadence independently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Computation of metrics</strong><br/>
 The PA module computes a variety of measures describing photometer
 performance, both as a health assessment and to support systematic
 error mitigation in following processing steps. <br/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The output of this module is a photometric time series. These light curves are then passed to the Pre-Search
 Data Conditioning (PDC) for correction of systematic errors.</p>
<h4 id="pre-search-data-conditioning-pdc">Pre-search Data Conditioning (PDC)</h4>
<p>The PDC software module examines the calibrated light curves produced
by PA and applies a series of corrections, based on known
instrumental and spacecraft anomalies as well as unanticipated artifacts
found in the data. "Pre-search" refers to data conditioning prior to
executing a transit search, which was undertaken by the next module in
the pipeline (TPS) for the Kepler mission only.</p>
<p>For a large range of variable sources, the output of PDC
appears well aligned with the output of PA, the quality of the light
curves are improved after correction for systematic errors, and the
instrinsic variabilty preserved. Users should exercise caution if
their phenomena of interest are much shorter (&lt;1 h) or much longer (&gt;5
d) than transit timescales, or display complex light curves with
timescales similar to those expected for Earth-like transits (1-10
hrs), e.g., eclipsing binaries.</p>
<p><strong>PDC functions</strong></p>
<p>PDC is executed in single channel "chunks", in which all sources
located on a single channel ("mod.out") are processed through the
software. PDC executes the following tasks in the order listed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data anomaly flagging</strong><br/>
Observations affected by known anomalies are flagged to
exclude their use in systematic error corrections. Discrete
discontinuities are introduced into the light curves by known
spacecraft activities such as the monthly Earth point downlinks for Kepler, and
commanded attitude adjustments, and by unanticipated events, e.g., the
occasional safe mode. In addition to missing data, photometry may be
present for some cadences but in a degraded form due to planned
activities such as the reaction wheel desaturations (affects 1 cadence
every 3 days for Kepler), and unanticipated events, e.g., Argabrightenings
identified by PA, and loss of fine point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resample ancillary spacecraft data</strong><br/>
Engineering data is obtained on a variety of timescales. Before
correlating these data to the photometry, the ancillary data is
rebinned to match the sampling rate of the long and short cadence data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identification and correction of discontinuities</strong><br/>
In addition to known data gaps described above, source-specific flux
discontinuities have been observed. Many, but not all, random
flux discontinuities are likely caused by impacts of solar and
galactic cosmic rays on the CCDs. Impulsive energy deposition from
cosmic rays alters the photo-sensitivity of individual pixels, which
may recover on a variety of timescales. In this step, PDC identifies
discontinuities in the light curves, and estimates the flux
offset. Discontinuities are corrected on a single or multiple cadence
basis, using the estimated offsets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify variable stars</strong><br/>
PDC attempts to separate "quiet" stars from variable sources, using a
tunable variability filter. Values of 0.5% and 0.25% center-to-peak
variation has been used in different data releases. This switch
determines the detrending options; variable stars are treated differently than
quiescent stars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify astrophysical events</strong><br/>
Astrophysical events must be identifed, as best as possible, to
prevent those events from affecting the correlation of the
synchronized engineering data to the light curves. These signatures,
e.g., giant planet transits, stellar eclipses, flares and microlensing
events, are located in the calibrated light curves, and replaced
temporarily with values interpolated across relevant cadences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Systematic error correction for quiet stars</strong><br/>
For sources below the variability threshold, the light curve is
compared to the resampled ancillary engineering data and centroid
motion time series to identify and remove correlated trends. This
process is termed cotrending in the Kepler documentation. A singular
value decomposition approach is utilized, to identify systematic
trends at many frequencies in the data which appear to be induced by
some spacecraft or detector process. An example would be an observed
flux variation correlated with periodic focus changes induced by
flexure in the optics. The goal of cotrending is to remove flux
signatures that are correlated with the ancillary data on the
specified time scales. During the first year of operation of the
Kepler mission, the project
 found that the systematic errors are caused primarily by target
motion at the pixel or sub-pixel level, which modifies the collected
signal. Cotrending against the centroid motion time series improves
the quality and noise content of the data. Another noise source is
thermal transients observed following safe modes and the monthly
downlinks. The changing thermal environment of the spacecraft
following these events induces focus changes, which alters the source
PSFs. These transients last a few days (1 day = 48 30-min
observations), affecting a few hundred long cadence
datapoints. Users should note that low amplitude periodic astrophysical
signals which are correlated with the ancillary data will likely be
compromised in the Kepler data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Systematic error correction for variable stars</strong><br/>
For sources exceeding the variability
threshold, PDC attempts to model periodic behavior, in order to fit
and remove this component and correlate against the underlying light
curve. Smoothly varying stars
are generally well-fit by PDC, preserving the astrophysical signal,
and reducing the noise level. For stars tagged as variable, the
following steps are taken:<br/>
<br/>
(a)   Correct for thermal transients and differential velocity aberration. <br/>
(b)   Fit the periodic content. If successful, remove the fitted harmonic content from the light curves. <br/>
(c)   Apply the cotrending procedure to the residual light curve. <br/>
(d)   Apply metrics to assess the results. <br/>
(e)   Choose the non-variable or variable cotrending result for each target initially identified as variable. <br/>
<br/>For some sources, the cotrending has been found to produce
unacceptable results. In these situations, the calibrated light curve
(PA output) is substituted for the cotrended light curve (PDC output). For these
targets, systematic effects which are a component of the cotrending
algorithm are not addressed in PDC.<br/>
<br/>An example of PDC systematic error correction for a variable star
observed by Kepler
without a strong periodic component is shown below. The star is variable on short
time scales; over Q3 two discontinuities are observed, along with a
linear term produced by differential velocity aberration. (Adapted
from DRN5.)<br/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="images/PDC_example3_quietstar_drn5.jpg" style="min-width:97%;"/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Correct excess flux</strong><br/>
Some of the signal within the optimal aperture arises from the PSF
wings of nearby sources, contaminating the signal from the target. PDC
subtracts an estimate of this excess flux, based on a source-specific
crowding metric, defined as the fraction of starlight arising from the
target star. This metric has a range of [0-1], where 1 implies all
light comes from the target, and 0 = all background. Simple aperture
photometry produced by PA is not corrected for source crowding. The
crowding metric is derived for Kepler targets from the distribution of surrounding stars
as tabulated in the KIC, and the measured structure of the
pixel-response functions of the source and nearby stars. Since each
source is observed on a different location of the focal plane each
quarter due to the quarterly roll, the PRFs, optimal
apertures, and crowding metric are defined for each quarter. Users will see an offset in flux level when plotting PA output
versus PDC output. The offset is a measure of the source contamination
correction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identification of outlying data points</strong><br/>
PDC searches for data points lying
outside (+/-) an adjustable range. A median filter is applied after
masking of potential astrophysical events, such as giant planet
transits, stellar flares, and microlensing. After removing the median,
the residual light curve is examined for points lying further than a
pre-set value. In the subsequent transit search phase for Kepler, flagged points
are filled ("gapped") via interpolation. However, light curves
available in the archive at MAST do not have outliers removed; the
data is unaltered for user interpretation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Performance and cautions</strong></p>
<p>The Kepler data pipeline was originally optimized for transit
searches. We note here some precautions for working with the
conditioned data (PDC).</p>
<p>Kepler is more sensitive then any previous photometer producing
near-continuous time series. The mission is also exploring a
variability domain not previously accessible. Therefore, we are
encountering subtleties in the data and the data processing not seen
before. </p>
<p>Users are reminded to compare the calibrated light curve (PA) to the
corrected light curves (PDC), to ascertain the reliability of any
astrophysical signature in your data. Following are examples of
specific situations found in PDC output of which the user should be
aware:</p>
<p>(a)   Fails to identify and correct a source-specific discontinuity. <br/>
(b)   Poor detrending may introduce noise into complex lightcurves. <br/>
(c)   May identify a stellar eclipse as a flux discontinuity. <br/>
(d)   Fail to accurately track slowly rising or declining flux levels over a quarter. If this linear term is correlated with centroid motion times series, the linear term may be removed from the data. <br/>
(e)   Positive outliers which are not flagged as real events. PDC may tag these events as discontinuities, and attempt to correct. </p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="images/PDC_example_Jenkinsb_fig3.jpg" style="min-width:97%;"/></p>
<p>Output of PA (top curve) and PDC (bottom curve) for a variable star
observed during Q1. This source displays periodic behavior with ~1%
peak-to-peak amplitude on a timescale of ~5 days. The figures show
that the overall source variability is preserved by PDC. Systematic
noise introduced by an onboard heater can be seen as the short period
wiggles in the upper light curves. This noise is removed by PDC as the
noise signal is correlated with ancillary engineering data.</p>
<p>Kepler is sensitive to an enormous volume of variability phase
space. Overall, the corrected light curves are
excellent probes of the underlying variations on a wide range of
sources. In broad terms, users should be cognizant of three types of
phenomena for which the validity of the corrected light curves warrant
caution:</p>
<p>(1) Low amplitude (10s-100s PPM) variability with periods &gt; 10 days. <br/>
(2) Strongly episodic variable stars, such as cataclysmic binaries. PDC may flag eruptive phenomena as discontinuities, or attempt a fit which may unintentionally modify the data. <br/>
(3) Complex light curves, exhibiting multiple varying components, for
example and eclipsing binary with one or both components also
variable.</p>
