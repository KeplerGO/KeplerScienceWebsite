and the pixel files are in the process of being transferred to the &lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2"&gt;MAST archive&lt;/a&gt;.
We anticipate that the data will become available to the public by the end of next week.
As for previous campaigns, there will be no proprietary period for using or publishing K2 data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/GuestInvestigationsC03.shtml"&gt;Campaign 3 target list&lt;/a&gt; included 16,375 standard long cadence and 55 standard short cadence targets.
In addition we have included large pixel masks over dwarf planet (225088) 2007 OR10, the planet Neptune and its moon Nereid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our pointing has been significantly better than our conservative pointing assumptions we used when we built our pixel cost algorithms. The result of this is that we can observe about double the number of targets from Campaign 5 onwards compared with Campaign 4 and earlier. The increase is from about 15,000 total to around 30,000 total. Unfortunately, the telemetry data to determine that we were able to do this was no available in time for the K2 GO Cycle 2 proposal deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this affect you? You may wish to consider submitting larger target lists than in previous cycles in any Cycle 3 proposals you are submitting. Now, as always there is a caveat here that you should not propose more target than you can justify but please be aware that the cost of a target is now lower.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Due date for K2 Guest Observer Cycle 3 Step-1 Proposal Fast Approaching</title><link href="http://keplergo.github.io/KeplerBlog/due-date-for-k2-guest-observer-cycle-3-step-1-proposal-fast-approaching.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-05-29T05:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplergo.github.io,2015-05-29:KeplerBlog/due-date-for-k2-guest-observer-cycle-3-step-1-proposal-fast-approaching.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The K2 Guest Observer Cycle 3 proposal call is observations of targets in Campaigns 8 and 10.

&lt;p&gt;Cycle 3 also include Campaign 9, which is dedicated to observing gravitational microlensing events. No proposals seeking to observe targets in C9 will be considered.

It serves as a repository for community-gathered follow-up data and is supported by the NASA &lt;a href="http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html"&gt;Exoplanet Archive&lt;/a&gt; infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to continuing to support Kepler via the original &lt;a href="https://cfop.ipac.caltech.edu/home/"&gt;CFOP website&lt;/a&gt;, this new service includes the K2 targets, and will eventually be expanded to support future missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is open to the entire community and currently contains magnitudes, finding charts, and nearby source lists for the targets from Campaigns 0-4 and the engineering campaign. A new feature allows users to designate possible planetary candidates, false positives and eclipsing binaries. ExoFOP-K2 will allow detailed searches of K2 targets similar to the CFOP search pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All content can be viewed and downloaded without logging in. A username and password are only required if you wish to upload data, notes, or files.

&lt;p&gt;There will be talks from Steve Howell (K2 Project Scientist, NASA Ames), Tom Barclay (K2 Guest Observer Office Director, NASA Ames), Doug Hudgins (NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program Scientist and K2 Deputy Program Scientist, NASA HQ) and Fergal Mullally (K2 Science Officer, NASA Ames), in addition to contributed talks from members of the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>K2 Microlensing Campaign Workshop, May 7-8, 2015, SETI Inst., CA</title><link href="http://keplergo.github.io/KeplerBlog/k2-microlensing-campaign-workshop-may-7-8-2015-seti-inst-ca.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-04-24T05:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplergo.github.io,2015-04-24:KeplerBlog/k2-microlensing-campaign-workshop-may-7-8-2015-seti-inst-ca.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In April of 2016, the NASA K2 mission will execute Campaign 9, a continuous 75-day long campaign targeting the galactic bulge dedicated to a single Microlensing Science Experiment. The &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2"&gt;NASA K2 mission&lt;/a&gt; is sponsoring a &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop"&gt;1.5-day workshop on the topic of the K2 Microlensing Experiment&lt;/a&gt; on May 7-8, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivations for holding this workshop are two-fold: Firstly to provide an opportunity for interactive planning for the K2 Microlensing Experiment amongst NASA, the K2 project and the scientific community; and secondly to serve as a pre-proposal discussion opportunity in advance of the submission of K2 Microlensing Science Team proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2 project staff will describe the observing plan and operating procedures for up-linking target lists, down-linking the observed data and the time-line for archiving products. NASA HQ and K2 staff will present information regarding the proposal process, possible avenues for investigation, and funding. We are also inviting attendees to present information valuable in the planning and preparation for the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop will begin at 9.00am PST on Thursday May 7 and end at 12.00pm PST on Friday May 8, 2015. The venue will be the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California.
