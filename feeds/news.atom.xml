&lt;p&gt;The workshop, called "NASA Planetary Science and Astrophysics Assets," will be held all day on Tuesday, 10 November 2015, in the Azalea 1 room at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between &lt;b&gt;9:00 am and 10:30 am&lt;/b&gt;, the workshop will focus on the K2 mission.
The schedule is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K2 background (15 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Thomas Barclay, NASA Ames&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting solar system bodies (10 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Geert Barentsen, NASA Ames&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K2 support and the ExoFOP (15 mins) - &lt;i&gt;NExScI&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observations of Neptune and Uranus (15 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Amy Simon (NASA GSFC)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pluto and the TNOs (15 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Csaba Kiss (Konkoly Obs., Hungary)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trojan Asteroids (15 min) - &lt;i&gt;Erin Ryan (NASA GSFC)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q&amp;amp;A (5 mins)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fields observed by K2 are close to the ecliptic plane
and rich in solar system objects including planets, asteroids 
and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). 
K2 has already performed observations of Neptune and its large moon Triton, 68 Trojan and Hilda asteroids, 5 TNOs (including Pluto) and Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring). About thousands of main-belt asteroids that fell into the pixel masks of stars have been have been serendipitously observed. Uranus will be observed in a future campaign (C8), as will many more small solar system bodies. Observations of moving bodies as bright as Jupiter and as faint as V=23 have proved successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2 has an ongoing funded Guest Observer program and which has been successfully proposed to by members of the planetary science community. We present K2’s plans and capabilities for solar system science and will have presentations by members of the planetary science community who have used K2 data. This presentation contains information about the mission and its capabilities, discusses the proposal cycles and provides examples, and has community folks talking about their K2 science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage members of the planetary science community interested in using the long-baseline, high-cadence, high-precision photometry provided by the Kepler spacecraft to join the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>K2 Science Conference Deadline Fast Approaching</title><link href="/k2-science-conference-deadline-fast-approaching.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-09-15T11:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:,2015-09-15:k2-science-conference-deadline-fast-approaching.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The September 18 deadline for early registration, hotel reservation, &amp;amp; abstract submission for the &lt;a href="http://lcogt.net/k2scicon/"&gt;K2SciCon&lt;/a&gt; is just a few days away.
The K2 Science Conference is hosted by the LCOGT and will celebrate the science from the first year of the K2 mission in sunny Santa Barbara. Hotel rooms are currently available at the government rate ($151) - a fantastic deal for Santa Barbara. However after Sept 18 the room rate will jump to over $300 per night. The registration fee also jumps to $425 after that date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All K2 users are welcome to present early scientific results from all areas of research, from our own Solar System and exoplanets to young stars and distant galaxies. The organizing committee are particularly interested in hearing those in the asteroseismology community and also encourage contributions on results from the Kepler prime mission and the upcoming TESS mission. &lt;/p&gt;

Given the proposal review timeline, and associated data processing and archive activities, there can be a significant delay between proposal submission and final target selection for each K2 campaign. To provide a faster mechanism for headline astrophysics with K2 we provide an alternative means for acquiring K2 data, through the Director's Discretionary Target (DDT) program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the DDT program for K2 is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respond to targets of opportunity, e.g. newly discovered exoplanets or supernovae&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yield high-impact science from K2 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance existing GO programs with additional data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DDT program for K2 occurs on a rolling basis; observations can be proposed for at any time starting with targets in Campaign 8. However, to ensure that approved targets are included in the final target lists for each campaign, proposals must be submitted by the following dates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 5, 2015 for Campaign 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December 10, 2015 for Campaign 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 10, 2016 for Campaign 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposals require a 2-page scientific justification and a target table and should be submitted at the &lt;a href="http://www.jotform.us/kcolon/submitk2ddt"&gt;DDT submission website&lt;/a&gt;. The required format as well as a &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/ProposalPreparationTargetTable.shtml"&gt;template for the target table can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. The fixed locations and observing windows of Campaigns 8, 9, and 10 are provided at &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/Fields.shtml"&gt;the field information page&lt;/a&gt;. Target overlap with the current GO target list will not be considered unless short cadence observations are being requested of a current long cadence target. DDT proposals will be sent to external reviewers; final selection will be at the discretion of the Guest Observer Office Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to observe several hundred targets through the DDT program, which amounts to a few per cent of the total targets allocated. The exact number of DDTs to be observed largely depends on the number of short versus long cadence DDTs approved. There is no proprietary period and no associated funding for approved DDT programs. Proposals from any institution are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We particularly encourage DDT proposals for Campaign 9, which is a non-standard campaign. The Campaign 9 microlensing experiment involves the Kepler spacecraft observing in the positive velocity vector (+VV) direction at fields toward the Galactic bulge. This allows for simultaneous observations from Earth during Campaign 9. &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>K2 Campaign 7 Science Program Available</title><link href="/k2-campaign-7-science-program-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-09-10T15:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:,2015-09-10:k2-campaign-7-science-program-available.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The K2 &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/GuestInvestigationsC07.shtml"&gt;Campaign 7 Target List&lt;/a&gt; has now been posted. In Campaign 7 there was a significant drop in the number of targets observed relative to previous campaigns. This drop was because the number of targets we can observe is a function of our on-board compression efficiency. The extremely dense nature of the Campaign 7 field forced us to assume a poorer compression estimate than we used for earlier campaigns. This target list consists of 13,469 standard long cadence and 72 standard short cadence targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tiled a region around the open cluster Ruprecht 147 using 60 individual pixel masks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we included large pixel masks over 3 Trojan/Hilda Asteroids and the (dwarf) planet Pluto. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled just a subset of the pixels that make up the path the Trojans/Hildas move along. These observations are in long cadence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also observed 10 very bright stars by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets but excluding the bleed columns.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Updated K2 Data Release Schedule</title><link href="/updated-k2-data-release-schedule.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-09-10T14:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:,2015-09-10:updated-k2-data-release-schedule.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The K2 project have updated the dates we expect to release K2 data to the &lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/"&gt;MAST&lt;/a&gt;.

In Campaign 4, 15,853 long cadence and 122 short cadence targets were observed. Additionally, large circular pixel masks were collected that cover bright 3-5 mag B-stars and red giants in the Hyades and Pleiades open clusters.  Data for these nine stars are listed by custom aperture number at MAST, rather than by EPIC number.  A Trans-Neptunian Object (2002 KY14) was also observed, and 1340 pixel masks were collected to cover the trajectory of this moving target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data release notes for Campaign 4 are available at &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/C4drn.shtml"&gt;http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/C4drn.shtml&lt;/a&gt;. Users are encouraged to read the release notes in full and note in particular the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the dust clouds near the Pleiades, the background removal near the cluster has larger than normal residuals. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/K2drn/C4/C4_reduced_ap_targets.txt"&gt;887 stellar targets&lt;/a&gt; that have light curves with more noise than expected, as they were likely created with non-optimal apertures.  This is due to incompatibility between K2 roll motion and determination of photometric optimal apertures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fraction (23.8%) of stellar targets have light curves generated from apertures that are larger than optimal because they have lower than expected flux compared to their Kepler magnitudes in the EPIC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A different group of stars have higher than expected flux, also resulting in non-optimal apertures.&lt;/li&gt;

In particular, we draw attention to the following changes
in the data processing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

by the target pixel files (column FLUX), bringing the K2 TPF files in line
with those that were previously made available for the prime Kepler mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New quality flags now indicate which cadences were obtained during a thruster firing (column QUALITY).&lt;/li&gt;

The resulting new scientific observation opportunities are a testament to ingenuity and teamwork, and we would like to help bring attention to your great work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all results are scientifically significant, there are some that hold the added luster of public appeal. At the basic level, public appeal can be qualified as 'firsts' (the first Earth-sized planet); has a tie to popular culture (Kepler-16b or "Tatooine" and is also a 'first'); or sparks curiosity (catching a supernova before the explosion, or a disintegrating planet). These are the hooks that grab the attention of the public and spurs additional learning. A news hook can be obvious but can require discussion to ferret out the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Geert Barentsen joins us from the University of Hertfordshire in the UK. Geert's background is in the exploitation of photometry from wide-area surveys. In Hertfordshire he leads the data processing of two projects which aim to map our own Milky Way in unprecedented detail: &lt;a href="http://www.iphas.org"&gt;IPHAS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.vphas.eu"&gt;VPHAS+&lt;/a&gt;. He also teaches a university's programming and statistics class, and is a contributor to the &lt;a href="http://www.astropy.org"&gt;AstroPy&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geert earned his doctorate at the Queen's University of Belfast in 2012 where he studied star formation using narrow-band photometry. Prior to his PhD, he obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Antwerp in Belgium, after which he gained professional experience in data science at the European Space Agency in The Netherlands and the Royal Meteorological Institute in Belgium. In his spare time, he studies the activity of meteor showers using data collected by amateur astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Knicole Colón leaves a postdoctoral role at Lehigh University as a member of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilodegree_Extremely_Little_Telescope"&gt;KELT project&lt;/a&gt; to join us at Kepler. Her expertise is in the discovery and characterization of transiting exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student at the University of Florida, Knicole demonstrated the capability of OSIRIS on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) for exoplanet science.  After earning her doctorate in 2012, she gained postdoctoral experience at the University of Hawaii and Lehigh University.  There, she focused on the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with narrow-band photometry and in the confirmation of planets around bright stars discovered by the KELT transit survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geert will start his new role in June 2015 and Knicole will join us a month later in July.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>K2 Microlensing Campaign Draft Agenda Now Available</title><link href="/k2-microlensing-campaign-draft-agenda-now-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-04-24T06:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:,2015-04-24:k2-microlensing-campaign-draft-agenda-now-available.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/Agenda/"&gt;draft agenda&lt;/a&gt; is now available for the &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/"&gt;K2 Microlensing Workshop&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;There will be talks from Steve Howell (K2 Project Scientist, NASA Ames), Tom Barclay (K2 Guest Observer Office Director, NASA Ames), Doug Hudgins (NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program Scientist and K2 Deputy Program Scientist, NASA HQ) and Fergal Mullally (K2 Science Officer, NASA Ames), in addition to contributed talks from members of the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>K2 Microlensing Campaign Workshop, May 7-8, 2015, SETI Inst., CA</title><link href="/k2-microlensing-campaign-workshop-may-7-8-2015-seti-inst-ca.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-04-24T05:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:,2015-04-24:k2-microlensing-campaign-workshop-may-7-8-2015-seti-inst-ca.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In April of 2016, the NASA K2 mission will execute Campaign 9, a continuous 75-day long campaign targeting the galactic bulge dedicated to a single Microlensing Science Experiment. The &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2"&gt;NASA K2 mission&lt;/a&gt; is sponsoring a &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop"&gt;1.5-day workshop on the topic of the K2 Microlensing Experiment&lt;/a&gt; on May 7-8, 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivations for holding this workshop are two-fold: Firstly to provide an opportunity for interactive planning for the K2 Microlensing Experiment amongst NASA, the K2 project and the scientific community; and secondly to serve as a pre-proposal discussion opportunity in advance of the submission of K2 Microlensing Science Team proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2 project staff will describe the observing plan and operating procedures for up-linking target lists, down-linking the observed data and the time-line for archiving products. NASA HQ and K2 staff will present information regarding the proposal process, possible avenues for investigation, and funding. We are also inviting attendees to present information valuable in the planning and preparation for the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop will begin at 9.00am PST on Thursday May 7 and end at 12.00pm PST on Friday May 8, 2015. The venue will be the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California.

This is a milestone release because it utilizes the first uniform processing of the entire Kepler data set and it represents a first attempt at fully automating the dispositioning process so as to produce a uniformly vetted catalog of planetary candidates (PCs) and false positives (FPs). This is being done via the use of "robovetters" - sophisticated decision trees that utilize a set of targeted metrics to mimic the decision-making process. While all KOIs in the Q1-Q17 DR24 KOI table are given dispositions, work on the robovetters is not yet complete. Thus, before the table is closed more KOIs will be added and dispositions will change.

This data was collected between Feb 4-13, 2014, before Campaign 0, and points to a different region of sky to Campaign 0, RA = 359 deg, Dec = -2 deg. In future publications and presentations, we would be grateful if you referred to these data collectively as the "Two-wheel Concept Engineering Test". The motivation for delivering this test data is described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help the community in the endeavor of maximizing photometric quality and precision of a two-wheel mission we have delivered &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/tpf_eng/"&gt;engineering data to the MAST archive&lt;/a&gt;. The Kepler spacecraft operated with fine-guidance, collecting data from 2,017 target masks. The properties and quality of the data therein is expected to be similar to those collected during Campaign 0 and provide an excellent opportunity for scientists to make an early and impactful start upon their investigations. Note also that the chances of there being undiscovered planet transits in this engineering set are high and the potential for other serendipitous science is great. To this end we have also provided lists of &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/tpf_eng/K2_E2_targets_lc.csv"&gt;long cadence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/tpf_eng/K2_E2_targets_sc.csv"&gt;short cadence&lt;/a&gt; targets with a brief description of why each was observed during the test. For those investigators eager to develop this test data scientifically and those investigators with the enthusiasm to develop new technical solutions for two-wheel photometry, we encourage you to dive wholeheartedly into this data set. A typical file size for one of these target pixel files is 26 MB. The Kepler Science Center will not support this engineering data with future reprocessings, deliveries or new products. However the Kepler Science Center will support questions through the helpdesk regarding this data set on a best-effort basis. &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
