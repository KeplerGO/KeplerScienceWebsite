This version introduced several new features and improvements, such as more sophisticated pixel calibration, better identification of spacecraft pointing, improved cosmic ray correction, and production of short-cadence lightcurves, along with several other minor improvements. Please see the &lt;a href="k2-uniform-global-reprocessing-underway.html"&gt;associated news post&lt;/a&gt; for details on each feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reprocessed data and release notes from campaigns 2, 3, and 13 have been made available over the past few months. The newest data are available via the usual &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/"&gt;K2 data download interfaces at the MAST archive&lt;/a&gt;; the older data has been kept available via the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/"&gt;MAST browser interface&lt;/a&gt; (e.g., &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/target_pixel_files/old_release_bundles/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for tarballs of the old TPF files and &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/lightcurves/old_release_tarfiles/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for tarballs of the old lightcurves files, if previously produced). The data release notes have been updated for each reprocessed campaign, available at the nominal &lt;a href="k2-data-release-notes.html"&gt;K2 Data Release Notes page&lt;/a&gt;; links to the old version of the release notes are also provided for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two figures below, we show the current status of major and minor new features and improvements as a result of the reprocessing effort. Below those, we highlight a few examples of these improvements and new features from C2, C3, and C13 that are likely to be of interest to users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img style="text-align: center" src="images/news/reproc-status-1-minor.png" width="100%" align="center"  class="img-responsive"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable changes to the data from campaigns 2, 3, and 13:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the original C2 processing, lightcurves were not produced, and TPFs were "Type-1", which had poor WCS information and other limitations compared to the "Type-2" TPFs that were produced in later campaigns. (For details on the difference between Type-1 and Type-2 TPFs, see &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/manuals/k2_handbook.pdf#page=15"&gt;section 2.4 of the K2 Handbook&lt;/a&gt;.) As a result of reprocessing, Type-2 TPFs, lightcurves (both long- and short-cadence), and cotrending basis vectors (CBVs) are now available for C2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major improvements from the global reprocessing is the use of an algorithm called "Dynablack", which is essentially a more sophisticated way to perform the CCD pixel-level calibration that accounts for time-varying, instrument-induced artifacts in the pixel data. One benefit of Dynablack is that is is able to correct crosstalk from the fine guidance sensors, resulting in much better background correction for certain channels. As shown below, for channel 41 in the original C2 processing, the old CCD calibration method resulted in varying background level as a function of position on the CCD. In the reprocessing, the use of Dynablack resulted in a significantly better correction and more uniform background levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="thumbnail" style="width: 80%; display: inline-block;"&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The residuals in the background correction fit as a function of row position on the CCD. &lt;b&gt;Left:&lt;/b&gt; The original C2 processing. &lt;b&gt;Right:&lt;/b&gt;The same figure from the C2 reprocessing. (Note the different y-axis scale between the two figures.)&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img style="text-align: center" src="images/news/c2-dynablack-correction.png" width="100%" align="center"  class="img-responsive"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As part of the reprocessing, we are now producing short-cadence lightcurves for all objects that were observed in short-cadence mode. We note that no work was able to be done to adapt the detrending method used for Kepler short-cadence lightcurves to those from K2, and thus on a whole they are expected to be of varying quality. However, we are producing them with the expectation that at least some objects will be of high quality, and/or their existence will spurn more detailed investigation. Below we show the short-cadence PDC lightcurve for EPIC 206003187, an RR Lyrae-type variable observed in C3. While there are still residual systematics near thruster-firing events, simply removing those points near thruster firing events results in a well-detrended phased light curve with a clearly visible &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazhko_effect"&gt;Blazhko effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="thumbnail" style="width: 56%; display: inline-block;"&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While examining the results of the C3 reprocessing we found that several thousand targets had significantly different optimal photometric apertures compared to the original processing. There appears to have been either a bug or configuration error in the original C3 processing that affected these targets; the reprocessed apertures appear correct, and upon subsequent examination we do not find this bug to have affected any other campaign. We show an example below for EPIC 206393582 where the pixels comprising the optimal aperture are identified via a transparent gray overlay. In the original processing, the optimal aperture was a single pixel to the right of the target, which is clearly wrong; in the reprocessing the optimal aperture is 4 pixels centered on the target. This was an unanticipated benefit of performing the global uniform reprocessing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="thumbnail" style="width: 80%; display: inline-block;"&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;

&lt;img src="images/news/c3-206393582-new-ap.png" width="48%" align="right"  class="img-responsive"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the original processing of C13, the presence of the first magnitude star Aldebaran on channel 73 led to a time-varying error in the smear correction for channel 74, which shares the same physical CCD (&lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/images/kepler_focal_plane_layout_channels_color.png"&gt;see the Kepler CCD layout&lt;/a&gt;). As a result, every target on channel 74 had time-varying background levels, and the resulting lightcurves showed a "chattering" effect of significant point-to-point changes in flux (see &lt;a href="http://localhost:8000/archived-k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-13-archived"&gt;the old C13 data release notes&lt;/a&gt; for details). Below we show an example target from channel 74, EPIC 246810163, a hot star with apparent astrophysical variability. As can be seen on the left, the "chattering" effect is visible in both the background flux and resulting lightcurve for this target. When reprocessing, an update to the smear correction routine was able to significantly better account for the flux bleed from Aldebaran, and thus result in a nominal, smoothly time-varying background flux and thus significantly better lightcurve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;a href="k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-20"&gt;approved targets &amp;amp; programs page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target list includes
&lt;b&gt;14,789 standard long cadence&lt;/b&gt;
and &lt;b&gt;210 standard short cadence&lt;/b&gt; targets
located towards the constellation of Taurus.
The Campaign partially overlaps with Campaigns 4 and 13,
while also surveying 20 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of previously unstudied sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign 20 will revisit the &lt;b&gt;Taurus-Auriga star-forming region&lt;/b&gt; in the forward-facing mode. The region contains a large number of very young stars (&amp;lt;10 Myr) and the Campaign will significantly increase the number of such stars observed by Kepler. The field also includes members of the Pleiades (∼100 Myr) and Hyades (∼600 Myr) star clusters. The observations will improve the estimation of planet occurence rates as a function of stellar age, and will also enable the baseline of variability studies of young stars to be extended by including targets previously observed during Campaign 4 (2015) and Campaign 13 (2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target list also contains a large number of main sequence stars, white dwarfs, flare stars, brown dwarfs, solar analogs, and classical variables which will enable a wide array of investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below illustrates the location of the field and its notable targets.
The red dots mark the location of cluster members.&lt;/p&gt;

at the Ames Research Center in California: Ken Mighell and Nick Saunders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Ken Mighell joined us from the National Optical Astronomy Observatory.
His background is in the analysis of CCD photometry for the
study of stellar populations and Local Group galaxies.
Ken is currently part of the K2 team responsible for assessing and assuring the quality
of the &lt;a href="k2-uniform-global-reprocessing-underway.html"&gt;K2 Uniform Global Processing effort&lt;/a&gt;
which is currently underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Saunders joined us from the University of Washington
where he recently obtained his Bachelor degrees in both Astrophysics and Literature.
During his studies, Nick worked with Prof Rory Barnes and Dr Rodrigo Luger on the
removal of instrumental noise from Kepler/K2 photometry
for the study of exoplanets.
Nick will be continuing this work during his pre-doctoral gap year

Recent &lt;a href="https://www.cis.rit.edu/"&gt;Center for Imaging Science&lt;/a&gt; PhD recipient Dmitry Vorobiev presented the study at the SPIE meeting on Astronomical Telescopes and Instrumentation in Austin, Texas in June 2018.  The &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07430"&gt;findings are posted on ArXiV&lt;/a&gt; and will appear in the upcoming Proceedings of the SPIE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Intra-Pixel Response Function is the mapping of detector sensitivity within a pixel boundary.  The IPRF imbues significant flux deficits and excesses as spacecraft-induced motion drags celestial photo-centers within a pixel.  These conspicuous instrumental flux changes dominate the variance of K2 aperture photometry.  &lt;a href="http://lightkurve.keplerscience.org/other_software.html#detrending-analysis"&gt;Several detrending algorithms&lt;/a&gt; account for these sawtooth-like artifacts in the flux time series.  The lab-based measurement of the IPRF will enable forward-modeling approaches such as Point Spread Function (PSF) photometry, needed for precision photometry in high stellar density fields.  Alternatively, quantifying this sub-pixel flat field can enhance the fidelity of &lt;a href="https://nksaunders.github.io/files/Example.html"&gt;synthetic K2 photometry&lt;/a&gt;, which can inform the reliability of data-driven heuristic methods.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mapping of the IPRF from in-situ K2 observations has been &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0653"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt;.  The new lab-based measurements offer both a clear signal of the characteristic doming structure and its wavelength-dependence.&lt;/p&gt;

and commanded the spacecraft into a no-fuel-use safe mode.
It will remain in this mode until August 2nd,
when the Kepler team will use the normally scheduled DSN time to downlink the Campaign 18 data.
This course of action was taken to preserve the 51 days of high-quality Campaign 18 data
that are currently held on the spacecraft’s solid state recorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA is continuing to prepare for Campaign 19 which is scheduled to begin August 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General questions related to Kepler’s low fuel state have previously been answered
in the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/kepler/fuel-status-faq"&gt;Kepler Fuel Status FAQ&lt;/a&gt;.
The extra FAQ below answers questions that are specific to the current and future K2 Campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will the quality of Campaign 18 data be affected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the first 51 days of Campaign 18 have been flawless.
The spacecraft performed nominally until the project commanded it
into its no-fuel "nap mode" in response to a drop in fuel pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When will Campaign 18 data become available?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project currently plans to downlink the data between August 2 and 6, 2018.
The raw data are expected to become available from the data archive at MAST
within a few days thereafter,
and the calibrated data products are expected to be released towards Q4 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Campaign 19 continue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA is continuing to prepare for Campaign 19.
If the observed drop in fuel pressure is indicative of the spacecraft running out of fuel,
then Campaign 19 may not be completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I continue to use my telescope resources to augment Campaign 19 data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several science programs seek to complement Campaign 19 data
using simultaneous observations carried out using other telescope facilities.
The PI's of these programs can phone the Kepler GO office at +1-650-604-2784
to request guidance as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I still propose targets for Campaign 20?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! NASA will continue to plan for future campaigns until the spacecraft can no longer operate nominally.
We expect to move the Campaign 20 target proposal deadline to August 16th, 2018,
i.e. beyond the start of Campaign 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does low fuel mark the end of Kepler’s discoveries?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not at all!
We expect that Kepler’s data set will continue to yield discoveries for years to come,
and that many planets are yet to be discovered
(e.g. &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11504"&gt;27 new planets from Campaign 10 were announced just last week&lt;/a&gt;).
NASA will continue to support and fund the analysis of the Kepler and K2 data sets
beyond the end of spacecraft operations.
Extrapolating from the success of Kepler's original mission,
we expect that K2's data set will yield more than 1,000 scientific publications over the coming years
(cf. figure below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="max-width: 600px;"&gt;

custom aperture photometry can be used to check your target
for the presence of time-variable background signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background flux level of Kepler pixel data is not static.
In particular, certain CCD channels occasionally experience the 'rolling band' effect,
where the background has a strong time varying component of a 'band' moving up the detector.
You can read more about rolling band in the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/KSCI-19033-001.pdf"&gt;Kepler Instrument Handbook&lt;/a&gt;.
An example of the rolling band artifact is shown in the video below.
You can see the band move through the superstamp at the 2 second mark,
leaving the bottom of the screen at the 6 second mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rolling band artifact is small, up to about 20 counts per pixel.
However, this can add up for large apertures containing many pixels or for faint, quiet targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolling band can often add spurious signals into your data which look like real astrophysical variability. 
The best way to spot rolling band is to vary your aperture size
or make lightcurves of nearby background pixels.
If the signal strength increases as you increase the number of background pixels in the aperture, the effect is likely to be an additive background component.
Our &lt;a href="http://lightkurve.keplerscience.org/tutorials/2.06-identify-rolling-band.html"&gt;new data analysis tutorial&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates how lightkurve can be used
to investigate the presence of the noise in your target of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="max-width: 600px;"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/news/rollingband.gif"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Animation of the superstamp obtained for the dwarf galaxy IC1613 during K2 Campaign 8.
Around the superstamp you can see smaller Target Pixel Files (TPFs) covering single objects of interest.
You can see a dark band move from the top of the superstamp to the bottom during the movie. This dark band and surrounding artifacts are the so-called "rolling bands".

have now been posted on the
&lt;a href="k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-19"&gt;approved targets &amp;amp; programs page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target list includes
&lt;b&gt;33,863 standard long cadence&lt;/b&gt;
and &lt;b&gt;216 standard short cadence&lt;/b&gt; targets
located towards the constellation of Aquarius.
The Campaign partially overlaps with Campaigns 3 and 12,
while also surveying ~15 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of previously unstudied sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable targets include the nearby planet systems &lt;b&gt;TRAPPIST-1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;GJ 9827&lt;/b&gt;.
These systems host some of the most amenable small planets for atmospheric characterization
known to date, i.e. TRAPPIST-1 f, GJ 9827 b, and GJ 9827 d.
The Hubble Space Telescope is scheduled to observe GJ 9827 b on September 16th and 21st, simultaneously with Kepler, obtaining a transmission spectrum to characterize water abundance in the atmosphere. Kepler will provide a unique photometric context to the Hubble observations for the purpose of constraining astrophysical noise such as star spots and provide precise transit modeling when HST is in Earth occultation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other notable targets include:
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;Dozens of confirmed and candidate exoplanets&lt;/b&gt; previously discovered
    during K2 Campaigns 3 and 12, including K2-138, the resonant system of
    five planets &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/multi-planet-system-found-through-crowdsourcing"&gt;discovered by citizen scientists&lt;/a&gt;,
    and HD 215152, a system &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A&amp;A...614A.133D"&gt;known to contain four short-period RV planets&lt;/a&gt;. 
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    A large sample of &lt;b&gt;low-mass flare stars&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;white dwarfs&lt;/b&gt;
    in short cadence.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;11,501 galaxies&lt;/b&gt; are being surveyed for supernovae and other transients.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;30 Solar System objects&lt;/b&gt; are being monitored, including the planet &lt;b&gt;Neptune&lt;/b&gt; and its moon Triton in short cadence, and comet 2P/Encke in long cadence.
  &lt;/li&gt;

the acquisition of unique calibration data using a new, experimental data collection mode
that requires no extra fuel.
On May 10-11, 2018, during the K2 Campaign 17 (C17) Deep Space
Network (DSN) downlink, the spacecraft collected and downlinked five Full Frame Images (FFIs)
after all C17 science data had been safely telemetered and spare DSN time remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the data downlink attitude, the spacecraft antenna points
towards Earth and the spacecraft rotates around the antenna boresight
without using fuel.
In this configuration the field of view drifts at ~0.3-0.5 arcseconds per second,
i.e. more than during science observations.
The resulting images are called &lt;em&gt;Driftscan Full Frame Images&lt;/em&gt; (DFFIs).
The data are expected to facilitate in-situ focal plane characterization and self-calibration,
ultimately useful for scene modeling and Point Spread Function (PSF) photometry
in crowded regions like star clusters or in extended objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driftscanning produces long overlapping star-trails on the FFI, rather
than conventional sharp point-sources.  The star trails extend over ~150 &amp;pm;20
pixels, corresponding to an average drift rate of ~0.35 arcseconds per second.
The direction of pointing of the telescope was not known a-priori, but can
 in principle be derived from the distinct constellation pattern of star trails.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driftscan FFIs were acquired with the same combined exposure time as
conventional 30-minute Long Cadence FFIs, &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt; 270 onboard-coadded
integrations with 6.02s exposure time and 0.52s readout time per
integration.  The DFFIs were collected within 16 minutes to 5 hours of the
previous frame, such that star trails can be seen moving across module
boundaries from frame-to-frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star trail line segments possess substructure suggestive of non-constant
image motion.  A longer-than-average dwell time of a point source causes regions of
"burn-in", while shorter-than-average dwell times cause relative dearths in flux.  The
resulting undulations appear in all the star trail line segments for a given
driftscan FFI.  The line segment substructures could also arise from the
shutterless image array transfer process occurring in phase with constant
image motion, yielding a "beating" phenomenon within pixel boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driftscan FFIs may enhance flat-field calibration of the Kepler focal
plane, since the relative response of adjacent pixels can be derived by
identifying local departures from the expected star trail illumination pattern.
Other uses for driftscan FFIs may eventually include solar system science and
short-timescale (few seconds) variations of bright astrophysical sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The raw driftscan FFIs are now available from the MAST archive at
&lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/k2/ffi/driftscan-ffi"&gt;https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/k2/ffi/driftscan-ffi&lt;/a&gt;.
The file format is identical to conventional raw FFIs.
These data should be considered experimental and will not be pipeline-calibrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image below shows a portion of one channel of one driftscan FFI.
Two presentations available online summarize the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qvK2vxBs1kMth0pgf-fBW4T1iGtU3e1-xCrVgHmMHxU/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;motivation for FFI driftscans&lt;/a&gt;,

Owing to the limited amount of spacecraft fuel remaining,
Cycle 7 is comprised of Campaign 20 only.
This post summarizes the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="campaign-20"&gt;Campaign 20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign 20 will revisit the &lt;strong&gt;Taurus-Auriga star-forming region&lt;/strong&gt; in the
forward-facing mode.
The region contains a large number of very young stars (&amp;lt;10 Myr)
and the Campaign will significantly increase the number of such stars observed by Kepler.
The field also includes members of the Pleiades (&amp;sim;100 Myr) and Hyades (&amp;sim;600 Myr) star clusters.
The observations will improve the estimation of planet occurence rates as a function of stellar age, and will also enable the baseline of variability studies of young stars to be extended by including targets previously observed during Campaign 4 (2015) and Campaign 13 (2017).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field 20 also contains a large number of main sequence stars, post-main sequence stars, and galaxies to enable a wide array of investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="target-and-funding-selection-process"&gt;Target and funding selection process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the selection process executed for K2 GO Cycle 6,
the solicitation presents a two-phase process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An optional &lt;strong&gt;Phase-1&lt;/strong&gt; proposal will enable &lt;strong&gt;targets&lt;/strong&gt; to be
selected for Campaign 20. Phase-1 proposals, including target tables
and a scientific rationale, are requested by &lt;strong&gt;August 16, 2018&lt;/strong&gt;
and must be submitted via email to keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov.
The scientific rationale must not exceed 2 pages for small programs
(less than 1000 targets) and 4 pages for large programs
(1000 targets or more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the spacecraft health and fuel allow,
then &lt;strong&gt;Phase-2&lt;/strong&gt; proposals for &lt;strong&gt;funding&lt;/strong&gt; will be due &lt;strong&gt;January 17, 2019&lt;/strong&gt;
via NSPIRES (see Section 7.1.2 of &lt;a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=610960/solicitationId=%7B8A2B07C0-F3D9-677F-0C28-F0E8406FC3CD%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/D.7%20K2%20Cycle%207%20Final%20Text%20Amend%2014%20final.pdf"&gt;the solicitation&lt;/a&gt;).
Phase-2 proposals are limited to use observations for targets which have
been selected as part of Phase-1.
The target list will be published in September 2018.
Phase-2 proposals are eligible to receive funding awards
between $30K and $150K, depending on the number of targets used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information about the proposal process, including the scope,
evaluation criteria, availability of funds, eligibility,
target selection tools, submission process, and frequently asked questions, is detailed on our &lt;a href="/k2-proposing-targets.html"&gt;proposal preparation page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="k2fov-update-required"&gt;K2fov update required&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigators interested in evaluating the visibility of targets during Campaign 20 must update their version of the
&lt;a href="software.html#k2fov"&gt;K2fov target selection tool&lt;/a&gt;
to version 8.0, released on 3 June 2018,
to take the new field position into account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2fov can be updated from the command line using pip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pip install K2fov --upgrade

from the &lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2"&gt;K2 data archive at MAST&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-16"&gt;target list&lt;/a&gt; featured
20,647 stars alongside 9,241 galaxies for the 
&lt;a href="supernova-experiment"&gt;supernova experiment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
Highlights included the M44 (Beehive) and M67 clusters, 
dozens of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates revealed by K2 Campaign 5,
and many late-type flare stars observed in short cadence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniquely, the spacecraft was pointing along the forward-facing direction
of the spacecraft's velocity vector during this Campaign,
which allowed the field to be accessed from Earth.
This enabled K2's single-bandpass photometry
to be complemented with &lt;a href="share-your-plan-for-k2-campaign-16-ancillary-observations.html"&gt;simultaneous observations from the ground&lt;/a&gt;.
For example, &lt;a href="panstarrs-monitoring-of-the-k2-campaign-16-field.html"&gt;PanSTARRS monitored the entire field every night in two filters&lt;/a&gt;
(cycling through g+r and g+i)
for the purpose of providing early alerts for transients in the field,
which were made public instantly via the 
&lt;a href="https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il"&gt;Transient Name Server&lt;/a&gt;.
The PanSTARRS imaging data are currently being transferred to the data archive at MAST and are expected to become available to the public in the course of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder: users are strongly encouraged to contact, cite, and collaborate with the teams who proposed the observations, as listed on the &lt;a href="k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-16"&gt;Approved Progams &amp;amp; Targets page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="k2-campaign-17-science-program-now-available.html"&gt;K2 Campaign 17&lt;/a&gt; last week,
on May 8th, and the full data set has now been downlinked to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable users to make use of the current visibility of the Campaign 17 field
from the ground, the raw C17 data have been made public immediately
via the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/k2/raw_cadence_data/c17/"&gt;K2 data archive at MAST&lt;/a&gt;.
The Campaign was focused, in part, on supernova science,
and it is thought that approximately 27 candidate supernova events
have been captured in the telemetered pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the raw, uncalibrated data files requires an intimate understanding
of their &lt;a href="raw-data-for-k2-campaign-12-and-trappist-1-now-available.html"&gt;format and caveats&lt;/a&gt;.
For scientific investigations that are not time-critical,
we recommend that users wait for the calibrated and quality-controlled
data products to become available in approximately 3 months.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, K2 Campaign 18 successfully started on Sunday morning,
May 13th, near midnight UTC. 
Uniquely, Campaign 18 is the third visit to the &lt;em&gt;K2 legacy field&lt;/em&gt;
which includes both the M44 (Beehive) and M67 open star clusters.
Campaign 18 overlaps entirely with C5, and partially with C16,
providing a dataset with a 3-year baseline and 8-month duty cycle
towards a Galactic sightline that is located 130 degrees away from the original Kepler field in Cygnus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tool strives to solve a common stumbling block in Kepler data analysis:
"&lt;em&gt;I see a blip in my lightcurve.  Is it real or instrumental?&lt;/em&gt;"
&lt;code&gt;interact()&lt;/code&gt; alleviates the guesswork by providing users with an easy-to-use
Python notebook widget to interactively inspect the pixel data
along a lightcurve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user can move a slider to rifle through cadences,
while seeing the postage stamp images update in real time.
A red vertical bar highlights the moment in the lightcurve.
Mousing-over individual lightcurve points flashes up a hover-over tool tip
with ancillary metadata about that particular cadence (e.g. quality flags).
The tool offers many avenues for customization,
including zooming, panning, and screen stretch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command &lt;code&gt;interact()&lt;/code&gt; is a method of the &lt;code&gt;KeplerTargetPixelFile&lt;/code&gt; class,
meaning that you can simply load in a target pixel file and append &lt;code&gt;.interact()&lt;/code&gt; to the file as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;lightkurve&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;KeplerTargetPixelFile&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You will need to upgrade your installation of &lt;code&gt;lightkurve&lt;/code&gt; to the latest version
(v1.0b5) for this to work. This can be done via the command line as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ pip install lightkurve --upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

C15 and later campaigns will be processed with the same pipeline version. This effort should enhance the scientific return of the K2 mission by providing users with a high quality, uniformly processed and documented K2 dataset. This work will be performed on a best-effort basis as long as mission resources are available to do so — there is no guarantee that the Mission will able to reprocess every old campaign. The campaigns have been prioritized by enhanced scientific return as a result of reprocessing. Note that processing and delivery of new campaigns (e.g., C16, C17, etc.) will always be prioritized over reprocessing of older campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Priority of Older Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;: C2, C13, C0, C11, C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C12, C14. (Not guaranteed to be actual order delivered due to processing constraints.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data will be delivered to the &lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2"&gt;K2 data archive at MAST&lt;/a&gt; as it is reprocessed, where the reprocessed data for a given campaign will replace the older processing when searching for data via &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/data_search/search.php"&gt;MAST's K2 Data Search and Retrieval page&lt;/a&gt; and any other interfaces. The older data will remain available to users via a subdirectory in the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/"&gt;MAST browser interface&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="changes"&gt;Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of pipeline changes have been grouped into two categories: Major and Minor. The Major changes affect the data at a significant level and/or are applicable to the vast majority of campaigns. The minor changes affect the data at a much less significant level and/or are applicable to only a small number of campaigns. At the end of each category a graphic is shown that visually demonstrates which campaigns are affected (or will be affected) by each change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="major-changes"&gt;Major Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="dynablack"&gt;Dynablack&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A feature of the Kepler pipeline that was used during Kepler prime processing, but until now had not been implemented for K2, is the use of Dynamic Black Correction, or "Dynablack", which is essentially a more sophisticated algorithm to perform the CCD pixel-level calibration that accounts for time varying, instrument-induced artifacts in the pixel data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynablack uses the full-frame images and collateral pixels to provide two main benefits compared to traditional pixel calibration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correct thermally dependent fine guidance sensor crosstalk pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify rolling-band artifacts (see &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/KSCI-19033-002.pdf#page=75"&gt;§6.7 of the Instrument Handbook&lt;/a&gt;) with flags in the target pixel files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can track rolling-band artifacts using the new RB_LEVEL flags in the FITS files. See &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/release_notes/release_notes25/KSCI-19065-002DRN25.pdf#page=11"&gt;§A.1.1 of the Kepler Data Release 25 Notes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/archive_manual.pdf#page=24"&gt;§2.3.2 of the Kepler Archive Manual&lt;/a&gt; for information on how to interpret and utilize the RB_LEVEL flags. In-particular, users should note that the RB_LEVEL test at the two shortest durations, 3 cadences (1.5 hours) and 6 cadences (3 hours), is overly sensitive to instrument noise and does not offer a reliable indicator of the presence of rolling band pattern noise. Because the binary "Rolling Band Detected" QUALITY and SAP_QUALITY flags (bits 18, 19) in the target pixel files and light curve files are based on a rolling band detection at any of the test durations (indicated by the keyword RBTDURi), they also do not provide a reliable indicator of the presence of rolling band pattern noise. The RB_LEVEL flags at durations greater than 6 cadences (3 hours) provide the best indication of the presence of rolling band artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in &lt;a href="#k2-proc-status-major"&gt;Figure Major-Proc-Status&lt;/a&gt;, Dynablack was never implemented for campaigns prior to C15, but will be implemented during the global reprocessing for old campaigns, as well as for new campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="not-in-fine-point-flag"&gt;Not in Fine Point Flag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout K2, software on-board the spacecraft would record when it considered itself not in fine point. The pipeline would flag these cadences as "Spacecraft is not in fine point" (QUALITY flag bit #16, decimal=32768) and the data would be gapped in both PA and PDC lightcurves. Starting with C14, a change in the on-board software resulted in additional cadences being flagged as "Spacecraft is not in fine point" (QUALITY flag bit #16, decimal=32768). Especially after this change, but also before, it was noticed that the "Spacecraft is not in fine point" flag was set on cadences that actually contained good data where the spacecraft pointing was acceptable for science observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in &lt;a href="#k2-proc-status-major"&gt;Figure Major-Proc-Status&lt;/a&gt;, the "Spacecraft is not in fine point" flag (QUALITY flag bit #16, decimal=32768) was used for all campaigns prior to C15. Starting with C15 and reprocessed campaigns, it is now ignored in the pipeline. See the next section, "Coarse Pointing Flag", for how cadences with poor pointing are now appropriately handled in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="coarse-pointing-flag"&gt;Coarse Pointing Flag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For C15+ and the global reprocessing, the pipeline is now using the "Spacecraft is in coarse point" flag (QUALITY flag bit #3, decimal=4) to identify cadences with significant pointing error. This flag is set by the mission based on the measured pointing error (using high-frequency sub-cadence telemetry) exceeding 1.5 pixels for 4 or more continuous cadences, or exceeding 2.5 pixels for a single cadence. The pipeline will treat these "coarse-point" cadences by gapping them in the PDC lightcurves for the flagged cadences. The mission has found that implementing this flag significantly improves the measured precision of the PDC lightcurves, both as a result of eliminating flux outliers due to poor pointing and PDC being able to focus more of its detrending power on correcting broad systematics and not single outliers. The mission recommends that starting with C15, users look to QUALITY flag bit #3 as an indicator of poor spacecraft pointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in &lt;a href="#k2-proc-status-major"&gt;Figure Major-Proc-Status&lt;/a&gt;, the coarse point flags were implemented starting with C14 and all new campaigns, and will be implemented for all reprocessed past campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="cosmic-ray-threshold"&gt;Cosmic-Ray Threshold&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kepler pipeline employs an algorithm to detect when cosmic rays impact the collateral area of the CCD, used to calibrate the pixel-level data, and correct for the cosmic rays so that the data are properly calibrated. The original Kepler pipeline was not designed to work with significant (&amp;gt; 1 pixel) motion, especially in the presence of very bright objects, which are both common to K2. As a result, it was noticed that the cosmic ray detection algorithm was sometimes falsely triggering, which resulted in an artificial suppression of the collateral smear data, and thus an under-correction of all pixels in an affected column. The net effect is the presence of bright columns in affected cadences (examples can be seen in the &lt;a href="k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-8"&gt;C8 data release notes&lt;/a&gt; under 'Intermittent Streaks'). This effect was not noticed to be significant until many campaigns had been processed, and varies significantly per campaign and channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After investigation, the mission determined the most effective course of action was to raise the threshold of the collateral cosmic ray detector from 4σ to 7σ, which struck a balance between minimizing false detections while still detecting and correcting for significant, real cosmic ray events. This should improve photometric precision by reducing the number of flux outliers in the lightcurves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in &lt;a href="#k2-proc-status-major"&gt;Figure Major-Proc-Status&lt;/a&gt;, the cosmic ray threshold was set to 4σ for C0–C10 and 7σ for C11 and all newer campaigns. The threshold will be set to 7σ for all new campaigns and reprocessed past campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="short-cadence"&gt;Short-Cadence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kepler pipeline corrects short-cadence PA lightcurves by interpolating from the long-cadence cotrending basis vectors (CBVs) that are produced as a result of long-cadence PDC. This method was not designed with the significant motion and resulting systematics that arise in K2 data, and as a result does a poor job of detrending K2 short-cadence data. For this reason, beyond an initial inspection based on C2, the mission did not attempt to produce short-cadence K2 light curves as part of its processing for C0–C14, as shown in &lt;a href="#k2-proc-status-major"&gt;Figure Major-Proc-Status&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the global reprocessing effort, the mission revisited the prospect of producing short-cadence light curves by doing so for C15. In consultation with the community, the mission decided that despite the overall poor detrending, there was value in having short-cadence light curves available for at least an initial inspection, especially given that currently short-cadence light curves are not produced for most short cadence targets as part of the community-delivered high-level science products. The hope is that these pipeline short-cadence light curves may be used for initial inspection of the short-cadence data, which might prompt users to perform their own short-cadence detrending, or better adapt the existing long-cadence &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/cbv.html"&gt;Cotrending Basis Vector (CBV) files&lt;/a&gt; for use in detrending the short-cadence data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with C15, as well as for all reprocessed data, an attempt to produce and deliver short-cadence light curves will be made — if significant issues arise in producing them for any campaign though, their production for that campaign may be abandoned in order to proceed with processing in a timely manner. Users are again strongly cautioned that no work was done to adapt the Kepler pipeline's detrending module (PDC), developed for Kepler data, to work well on short-cadence K2 data. &lt;em&gt;Thruster firings are especially poorly corrected for most short-cadence targets, and other systematic features may not be corrected well.&lt;/em&gt; See Figure C15-SC-Example-1 in the &lt;a href="k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-15"&gt;C15 data release notes&lt;/a&gt; (under the section 'Short Cadence Light Curves') for an example of remaining systematics in short-cadence data around thruster firings. However, some targets do have adequate detrending in short-cadence, and even in the cases of poor detrending, short-term astrophysical variation can be seen for targets where such astrophysical variation exists. See Figure C15-SC-Example-2 in the &lt;a href="k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-15"&gt;C15 data release notes&lt;/a&gt; where the ~18 min periodic variations of the AM CVn type binary HP Lip are readily apparent in the C15 short-cadence light curve. It should also be noted that short-cadence lightcurve production will be performed at a low-priority, best-effort basis, such that if any errors occur when processing the short-cadence light curves, the mission will not expend resources to do so if it affects the ability to process long-cadence data for other campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="minor-changes"&gt;Minor Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="lde-parity-error-flag"&gt;LDE Parity Error flag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An 'LDE Parity Error' flag is set on-board the spacecraft for all targets when a bright object on that channel bleeds into the serial readout register area of the CCD and results in an out of bounds value in the analog-to-digital converter. Since this was an extremely rare event during the Kepler mission, the pipeline was set to discard all cadences flagged as 'LDE Parity Error' in both the target pixel and lightcurve files for all targets. With K2, there are many bright stars, and bright, moving planets that occur in several campaigns. This results in the 'LDE Parity Error' flag being tripped for multiple cadences in several campaigns. Specifically, 1,237 cadences are flagged in C2 most likely due to the Kp~4 star EPIC 205283834, 128 in C6 most likely due to Spica, 148 in C11 most likely due to Saturn, and between 2–11 cadences in all other campaigns. Inspecting the cadences, the actual data was found to not exhibit any defects, and thus these cadences should ideally not be discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in &lt;a href="#k2-proc-status-minor"&gt;Figure Minor-Proc-Status&lt;/a&gt;, the pipeline was set to discard cadences based on the 'LDE Parity Error' flag for C0, C1, C3, C4, C6, and C8. No ill effects were seen in the other campaigns when the pipeline was set to ignore the flag. Thus, for C15 and all future campaigns, as well as all reprocessing, the pipeline will continue to ignore the flag, which will result in more cadences with good data available to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="momentum-dump-flag"&gt;Momentum Dump Flag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 'Momentum Dump' flag is set on-board the spacecraft for all targets when the spacecraft initiates a momentum dump (a.k.a. a 'Re-Sat'). This happens about every 2 days as part of normal K2 operations to maintain spacecraft pointing with two reaction wheels. During this time, the spacecraft can move up to half a degree within a cadence, which will significantly affect the ability to measure accurate photometry during an affected cadence. The Kepler pipeline is nominally set to discard cadences flagged as 'Momentum Dump' in both the target pixel and lightcurve files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in &lt;a href="#k2-proc-status-minor"&gt;Figure Minor-Proc-Status&lt;/a&gt;, the pipeline utilized the 'Momentum Dump' flag for C0–C5 and C11–C15. For C6–C10, the mission experimented with setting the pipeline to ignore the flag, as there was a possibility that some of these flagged cadences did not have significant motion and might produce accurate photometry. However, upon examination based on the C6–C10 data, the mission found that indeed these flagged cadences should be discarded and accurate photometry was not able to be recovered for them. Thus, for C15 and all future campaigns, as well as all reprocessing, the pipeline will discard cadences flagged as 'Momentum Dump' (QUALITY and SAP_QUALITY bit #6, decimal value = 32) in both the target pixel and lightcurve files. This will result in ~40 less cadences for C6–C10, but likely improved light curves as PDC will be able to better detrend the data without have to spend power on correcting flux outliers as a result of the momentum dumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="c13-smear-coefficient"&gt;C13 Smear Coefficient&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In C13, the 1st magnitude star Aldebaran on channel 73 bleeds heavily into the serial register of the CCD, corrupting the first three rows of the masked smear region. While these rows are not used for the smear correction, at times during C13 the saturation spill covered more rows in the masked smear, extending up to row 15 on channel 74 (see figure Aldebaran in the &lt;a href="k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-13"&gt;C13 data release notes&lt;/a&gt; under the section 'Smear Correction Error on Channel 74'). Trailing black rows 7-18 are fit with a linear model to estimate the black (bias) level for the masked smear region. At these times, the trailing black estimate for the masked smear signal was corrupted, resulting in corrupted black and smear measurements for the affected cadences. Since the black signal is subtracted from all the pixels in the channel, all targets on channel 74 were affected for these cadences, resulting in light curves that show significant chatter in baseline flux level for affected cadences. The black and smear corruption effects were most prominent in the first 80 cadences of the campaign and again in the period between cadence 1800-3200 (see Figure Channel 74 Trailing Black in the &lt;a href="k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-13"&gt;C13 data release notes&lt;/a&gt; under the section 'Smear Correction Error on Channel 74'). The net effect is to render the data for targets on channel 74 in C13 nearly unusable for science study (without significant work by users to recalibrate the pixel data).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in &lt;a href="#k2-proc-status-minor"&gt;Figure Minor-Proc-Status&lt;/a&gt;, this effect is unique to C13. When C13 is reprocessed, the black level model coefficients for channel 74 will be manually set to reasonable values for all cadences, thus producing nominal data for all targets on channel 74.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="ffi-interpolation-bug"&gt;FFI Interpolation Bug&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there are more than one FFIs in a given campaign, the Kepler pipeline interpolates data between those FFIs, and extrapolates before and after each, to account for variations over time when calibrating the pixel-level data. A bug was discovered where FFIs from later campaigns were used to interpolate for calibration of the current campaign. Since there are usually two FFIs per campaign, taken ~1/3 and ~2/3 the way through, this bug affected the pixel-level data (and thus lightcurves and other products as well) for the last ~1/3 of a campaign, where the interpolation was between the last FFI of the current campaign and the first FFI of the next campaign (with a different field-of-view). The latest cadences of the campaign are affected the most. The exact impact of the effect is not known, but is thought to be small given that the FFI data are only used to supplement the undershoot correction in calibration and the interpolation will weight the FFI values towards the correct campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in &lt;a href="#k2-proc-status-minor"&gt;Figure Minor-Proc-Status&lt;/a&gt;, because campaigns were predominately processed in the order they were observed, this bug only affected C1 and C2, which were processed when FFIs for later campaigns were already ingested. The bug has been fixed in the pipeline code and so C1 and C2, as well as any other campaigns, will not suffer from it when reprocessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="scrambled-uncertainties"&gt;Scrambled Uncertainties&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bug in the Kepler pipeline was discovered that caused the uncertainties on the smear calibration data for each column to be randomly scrambled, i.e., while each column's smear value was correct, it had a random uncertainty from another column, which can vary by ~20% column-to-column. When these uncertainties are propagated into the pixel-level flux value uncertainties, it results in incorrect flux uncertainties on the level of ~0.3%. The biggest impact this has is on the selection of the optimal photometric aperture, the algorithm for which is known to be overly sensitive to the uncertainties. Tests performed by the mission with the bug present versus the bug fixed confirm that while the bug had no significant effect on overall photometric precision, it did cause a significant change in the photometric aperture selected for a small number of targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in &lt;a href="#k2-proc-status-minor"&gt;Figure Minor-Proc-Status&lt;/a&gt;, C0–C10 were affected by this bug before it was detected and corrected, and thus will not contain the bug after when they are reprocessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="undelivered-targets"&gt;Undelivered Targets&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the initial processing for three campaigns there were various reasons that some targets did not have target-pixel and/or light-curve data delivered. For C2, no lightcurves were delivered as the Kepler pipeline had not been fully adapted to work for K2 at the time, and until the code was finalized, it was deemed best to just produce target pixel files. For C2, C11a, C11b, and C14, there were 2–3 targets each that had an error when computing their centroids such that no WCS information was available and a FITS file could not be created for those targets, and thus no target pixel files nor lightcurves were delivered. For C11b, there were 191 targets that did not have delivered target pixel files or lightcurves due to a bug in how the pipeline FITS file creator was configured to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in &lt;a href="#k2-proc-status-minor"&gt;Figure Minor-Proc-Status&lt;/a&gt;, only C2, C11, and C14 had undelivered targets. For global reprocessing, all the issues mentioned above have been fixed/addressed and thus the mission expects to be able to successfully deliver the missing files when the affected campaigns are processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

the K2 Guest Observer Cycle 6 are due in one month, i.e.
&lt;strong&gt;by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on April 19, 2018.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cycle 6 Phase-2 solicitation offers the opportunity to obtain funds
to execute scientific investigations which require the analysis of observations
obtained as part of K2 Campaigns 17, 18, or 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding amounts will be determined formulaically
based on the number of targets the proposal will utilize.
Award sizes will range from $30K for a few targets to up to $50K
for 999 targets. Proposals which will utilize over 1000 targets may receive
up to the maximum award amount of $150K.
We anticipate that approximately 12-20 small programs
and 5-6 large programs will be selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cycle 6 solicitation is &lt;a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId={7DC22936-4C6A-44FC-74A3-F0C9248DC9DD}&amp;amp;path=open"&gt;available at NSPIRES&lt;/a&gt;.
Further information about the proposal process, including the scope,
evaluation criteria, availability of funds, eligibility,
submission process, and frequently asked questions,
is detailed on the &lt;a href="/k2-proposing-targets.html"&gt;proposal preparation page&lt;/a&gt;
on this website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to previous K2 GO Cycles, we draw attention to the following changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase-2 proposals are limited to use observations for targets which have already been selected to be observed during K2 Campaigns 17, 18, or 19, i.e. which are listed on the &lt;a href="k2-approved-programs.html"&gt;K2 approved targets &amp;amp; programs&lt;/a&gt; page.  The target lists for these Campaigns have already been established based on the peer review of Phase-1 proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any team may submit a Phase-2 proposal using any of the targets that appear in the target lists of Campaigns 17, 18, or 19.
A Phase-1 submission is not mandatory to qualify for Phase-2.
Likewise, teams who submitted Phase-1 proposals are permitted to change the
scope of their proposed investigation and the composition of their team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposers must include target tables which detail the objects their investigation will analyze.  The tables must both be embedded within the body of the proposal package that is uploaded to NSPIRES, and electronic copies of the tables must also be submitted via e-mail to the Kepler &amp;amp; K2 GO Office (keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov) by the deadline.
The required target table format is documented on the &lt;a href="/k2-proposing-targets.html"&gt;proposal preparation page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the future Campaigns are at risk of spacecraft fuel running low, proposers may wish to clarify, as part of their proposal,
to which degree the scientific objectives of the proposed investigation can be met using data from Campaigns 17 or 18 alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the Phase-2 submission, NSPIRES will request a mandatory
  Data Management Plan (4000 characters). 
  Proposers are encouraged to explain how the results, data, and source code produced by the investigation will be made public as part of this plan.

&lt;p&gt;Lightkurve is an open source community project owned by the authors.
The development &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve"&gt;takes place on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
and everyone is &lt;a href="http://lightkurve.keplerscience.org/contributing.html"&gt;invited to contribute&lt;/a&gt;.
It replaces the existing &lt;a href="http://pyke.keplerscience.org"&gt;PyKE&lt;/a&gt; suite of command-line tools, which will slowly be migrated to become the command-line interface for the lightkurve package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Campaign 18 target list includes
&lt;b&gt;20,929 standard long cadence&lt;/b&gt;
and &lt;b&gt;234 standard short cadence&lt;/b&gt; targets
located towards the constellation of Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field is almost identical to that observed during Campaign 5
and overlaps substantially with Campaign 16.
The third visit to this key part of the sky that contains the M44 and M67 star clusters will enable users to study benchmark targets with a 3-year baseline and 8-month duty cycle, enabling original Kepler-like science at a Galactic sightline that is located 130 degrees away from the original Kepler field in Cygnus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
    Notable targets include:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Two open star clusters&lt;/b&gt;:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;M44&lt;/b&gt; is one of the most nearby open star clusters
            and is known to contain at least six confirmed planets
            (K2-95b, K2-100b, K2-101b, K2-102b, K2-103b, K2-104b).
            Its members are being observed using standard masks.
          &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;M67&lt;/b&gt; is the benchmark star cluster
            with solar-like age and metallicity.
            Hundreds of stars in the cluster core are being observed
            using 121 unique 40x40-pixel long cadence aperture masks
            which create a contiguous 440x440 pixel region.
            In addition, hundreds of members in the outskirts
            are being observed using standard masks,
            and more than 40 targets are being observed
            using short cadence masks.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;42 confirmed exoplanets from Campaign 5&lt;/b&gt;:
        K2-34b, 95b, 97b, 98b, 100b, 101b, 102b, 103b, 104b, 105b, 108b,
        114b, 115b, 117bc, 118b, 119b, 120b, 121b, 122b, 123b, 124b, 146b,
        180b, 181b, 182b, 183bcd, 184b, 185b, 187bcde, 188bc,
        and HIP 41378 bcdef.
        Most noteworthy, the HIP 41378 system is a bright F-type dwarf (V=9)
        shown by Campaign 5 to host at least five planets.
        The majority of these confirmed planet systems are being observed
        in short cadence.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;Dozens of unconfirmed planet candidates&lt;/b&gt; from Campaign 5
        are being re-observed, the majority in long cadence.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;60 low-mass flare stars&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;59 variable white dwarfs&lt;/b&gt;
        are being observed in short cadence.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;13 very bright stars&lt;/b&gt; are being observed
        using custom circular masks, including
        &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_Cancri"&gt;ζ Cancri&lt;/a&gt;
        and 25 Cancri in short cadence,
        and  η, γ, X, 21, 29, 49, 50, and 60 Cancri in long cadence.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;OJ 287&lt;/b&gt; is a well-studied bright galaxy (V=15) which is
        thought to show lightcurve variations due to a &lt;b&gt;binary supermassive black hole&lt;/b&gt; at its center.  It is being observed in short cadence.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;37 Solar System objects&lt;/b&gt; including
        22 comets and trojan Asteroids,
        9 faint Trans-Neptunian Objects, and the
        &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis"&gt;
        potentially hazardous asteroid 99942 Apophis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
        are being observed in long cadence.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

at 09:06:39.6 +19:20:17.5 in the galaxy UGC 4780.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/k2sn/PZPtW6myNjs/btW_E3BIAwAJ"&gt;initial spectroscopic follow-up&lt;/a&gt; indicates that the event
is a Type Ia supernova which is still rising
and is several days away from reaching its maximum brightness.
We encourage the community to continue to coordinate the follow-up
of this unique event via the &lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/k2sn/PZPtW6myNjs"&gt;K2 Supernova Experiment Google Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This event is expected to yield the highest-precision lightcurve ever obtained for a supernova.&lt;/strong&gt;
Kepler is providing a continuous 30-minute cadence view of the event
from December 7th through February 25th,
i.e. starting 2 months before and ending 3 weeks after the explosion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flyer …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;During Campaigns 0 through 14,
the K2 mission has now targeted an estimated 297,991 objects, including
50,159 cool dwarf stars,
37,041 giant stars,
40,125 galaxies,
and 1,560 white dwarfs.
&lt;strong&gt;The number of confirmed K2 planets recently surpassed 200 and
&lt;a href="https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/counts_detail.html"&gt;now stands at 212&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flyer below, which was distributed at the recent Winter AAS meeting,
summarizes a few of these statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These numbers will further increase upon the upcoming data releases
for Campaign 15 and 16.
We also note that the numbers do not include the very large number of objects observed
as part of the large "superstamps" collected towards the Galactic Bulge
and multiple clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M67&lt;/strong&gt;: the solar-age, solar-metallicity benchmark cluster observed during C5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruprecht 147&lt;/strong&gt;: the ~3 Gyr-old open cluster observed during C7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Lagoon Nebula (M8)&lt;/strong&gt;: the high-mass star-forming region observed during C9.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the data for these regions have long been served on MAST,
until now they were only available as a disconnected set of smaller Target Pixel Files (TPFs) because the spacecraft stored these observations in small chunks.
As a result, these regions have hitherto been ignored by many lightcurve and planet search pipelines.
With &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2superstamp/"&gt;this new release&lt;/a&gt;,
we have stitched these TPFs together into spatially contiguous FITS images
(one per cadence) to make their scientific analysis easier.
In addition, each image has been fit with an accurate WCS solution
so that you may locate any object of interest via its right ascension and declination.
The process of stitching and astrometric calibration is described in a
&lt;a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/aaac30/meta"&gt;companion RNAAS article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of these superstamp FITS images makes the analysis of the open star clusters observed by K2 much easier.
In the future, we expect to release similar products for other superstamp regions observed by K2, including galaxies and globular clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, we draw attention to the fact that more cadences
than usual were flagged as "Spacecraft is not in fine point" (QUALITY flag bit #16, decimal=32768) due to a lowering of the on-board fine point fault logging threshold, which did not otherwise affect pointing performance.
The project has identified a workaround for the flagging resulting from this changed threshold and has implemented it for future (re-)processing starting with C15.

PI teams may expect to receive feedback on their proposals by March.
Note that US-based investigators may be eligible to obtain funding to analyze
the data obtained as part of this Campaign by submitting a Phase-2 proposal
before the deadline, which is currently set for April 19, 2018,
i.e. after the the successful start of Campaign 17 is confirmed. &lt;a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary!init.do?solId={7DC22936-4C6A-44FC-74A3-F0C9248DC9DD}&amp;amp;path=open"&gt;See NSPIRES for details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Campaign 17 target list includes &lt;b&gt;34,398 standard long cadence&lt;/b&gt;
and &lt;b&gt;179 standard short cadence&lt;/b&gt; targets
located towards the constellation of Virgo.
Like Campaigns 9 and 16, this is a forward-facing field which enables
simultaneous observations to be carried out from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign 17 provides a substantial overlap with Campaign 6,
offering a longer baseline for stellar activity, asteroseismology,
and AGN studies,
as well as enabling dozens of K2 planet candidates to be revisited.
The field also provides access to 20 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
of previously unexplored sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable &lt;b&gt;long cadence targets&lt;/b&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spica&lt;/b&gt;: the brightest star system in the constellation of Virgo (V=1),
  known to be an ellipsoidal variable.
  The object is being observed using a 40px-diameter circular mask
  (ID 200213067) designed to capture the PSF core and wings while excluding
  the long saturation columns which will bleed off silicon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3,000+ candidate M dwarfs&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;10,000+ candidate FGK dwarfs&lt;/b&gt;
  for planet searches and other investigations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;14,000+ galaxies&lt;/b&gt; for the
  &lt;a href="supernova-experiment/"&gt;K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;24 Solar System objects&lt;/b&gt;
        including comets 183P/Korlevic-Juric and 235P/LINEAR,
        main-belt asteroids (223) Rosa and (422) Berolina,
        9 Trans-Neptunian Objects, and 11 Jupiter Trojan/Hilda Objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targets being observed in &lt;b&gt;short cadence&lt;/b&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Six confirmed planet systems&lt;/b&gt; from Campaign 6
  (K2-41 = WASP-157, K2-99, K2-110, K2-126, K2-127, K2-128).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dozens of planet candidates&lt;/b&gt; from Campaign 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;67 variable white dwarfs&lt;/b&gt;,
  including the bright white dwarf WD 1327-083 (V=12).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;47 cool flare stars&lt;/b&gt;,
  including the bright K-type flare star EQ Virginis (V=9).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;17 bright solar-type stars&lt;/b&gt; for asteroseismology studies.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Owing to the overlaps with previous fields,
C18 offers the opportunity to revisit targets from C5, 
while C19 enables re-observations of objects from C3 and C12.
DDT proposals based on recent analyses of these previous fields,
e.g. newly-discovered planet candidates, are particularly encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DDT proposals are due by 23:59 PT (Pacific Time) on the following dates: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Campaign 18: Jan 19, 2018&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Campaign 19: Apr 12, 2018&lt;/li&gt;

where users can receive K2-specific alerts by signing up for the "KEGS-C16" alerts category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first week of C16,
PanSTARRS has already identified two events in galaxies
which are currently being observed by Kepler:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2017iws"&gt;2017iws&lt;/a&gt;: a Type Ia supernova (z=0.09).&lt;/li&gt;

with this activity are encouraged to subscribe to the

&lt;p&gt;The imaging data collected by PanSTARRS for K2 is expected to be released
to the public no later than June 1st, 2018.
The release will include images in g, r, and i
for the entire field to a typical depth of 21st magnitude
and with a typical cadence better than 1-2 days.
These PanSTARRS data are expected to benefit multiple galactic and extragalactic investigations associated with Campaign 16.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>K2 Campaign 16 successfully underway</title><link href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-campaign-16-successfully-underway.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-19T01:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-12-19T01:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Geert Barentsen</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2017-12-19:/k2-campaign-16-successfully-underway.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;K2 Campaign 16 started successfully on December 7th

which allows the field to be accessed from Earth during Kepler's observations.
This enables K2's single-bandpass photometry to be complemented with simultaneous color photometry and spectroscopy from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, members of the extragalactic community are taking advantage
of this opportunity to &lt;a href="/panstarrs-monitoring-of-the-k2-campaign-16-field.html"&gt;execute rapid follow-up of transients&lt;/a&gt;.
At the same time, teams led by Dr Sharon Wang (see &lt;a href="https://RVxK2.com"&gt;RVxK2.com&lt;/a&gt;) and Dr Alexandre Santerne (see the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/a_santerne/status/934077306313863169"&gt;K2 Stellar Activity Campaign&lt;/a&gt;) are collecting
simultaneous high-precision RV observations of bright stars in the K2 field.

&lt;p&gt;We warn that our planet's passage will temporarily add noise to multiple CCD channels due to scattered light and saturation effects.
To map the scattered light, the Campaign's first Full Frame Image (FFI)
has been scheduled to capture Earth and Moon while they are in the field of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth-Moon FFI will start on Sunday December 10 at 21:38 Universal Time (4:38pm Eastern, 1:38pm Pacific)

Kepler will be above the horizon across the United States at this time, so don't forget to smile and wave towards (ra, dec) = (320.4, -15.7) degrees

have now been posted on the
&lt;a href="k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-16"&gt;approved targets &amp;amp; programs page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Campaign 16 is scheduled to run from
    &lt;b&gt;2017 Dec 7 (~22h UT) through 2018 Feb 25 (~13h UT)&lt;/b&gt;.
    The target list includes 29,888 standard long cadence
    and 129 standard short cadence targets
    located towards the constellation of Cancer.
    The list includes &lt;b&gt;20,647 stars alongside
    9,241 galaxies for the &lt;a href="supernova-experiment"&gt;supernova experiment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Uniquely, the spacecraft will be pointing along the forward-facing direction
    of the spacecraft's velocity vector during this Campaign,
    which &lt;b&gt;allows the field to be accessed from Earth&lt;/b&gt;.
    This enables K2's single-bandpass photometry
    to be complemented with simultaneous observations from the ground,
    an opportunity that is being utilised by many of the selected programs,
    e.g. to characterize supernovae in the field, and to carry out
    simultaneous high-precision RV observations alongside K2's photometry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    The field contains two important clusters: &lt;b&gt;M44 (Beehive) and M67&lt;/b&gt;.
    M44 is one of the most nearby open clusters;
    its members are being observed using standard masks.
    M67 is a benchmark cluster with solar-like age and metallicity;
    the stars in its core are being observed using a 400-by-360&amp;nbsp;pixel
    custom mask that covers the same area of the sky
    that was previously covered by a 400-by-400&amp;nbsp;pixel custom mask in Campaign 5,
    except for a 40px-wide strip that is not on silicon in C16.
    In addition, hundreds of members in the outskirts of M67
    are being targeted using standard long cadence masks,
    and 39 members are targeted using short cadence masks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Other notable targets in Campaign 16 include:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;Dozens of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates revealed by
            K2 Campaign 5&lt;/b&gt;,
            including several discovered in the Beehive cluster
            (K2-101b, K2-102b, K2-103b, K2-104b, EPIC 211901114b)
            and the confirmed hot Jupiter K2-34b.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;Nearby late-type flare stars&lt;/b&gt;
            including LHS 2090 (M6.5), DP Cnc (M3.5),
            DS Cnc (M4), and AZ Cnc (M6).
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;9 very bright stars&lt;/b&gt; are being observed using custom circular masks,
            including HD 76333 and 45 Cancri in short cadence,
            and α, δ, η, and ξ Cancri in long cadence.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;19 Solar System objects&lt;/b&gt; including asteroid Hekate,
            comets 288P and 2009 YD7, 4 Trojan asteroids,
            and 12 Trans-Neptunian Objects.
        &lt;/li&gt;   
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Finally, a consequence of the forward-facing geometry is that
    our own &lt;b&gt;Earth-Moon system&lt;/b&gt; will be moving across the focal
    plane during the first 3.5 days of the Campaign.
    We warn that our planet's passage will add noise to multiple CCD channels
    due to scattered light and saturation effects.
    Ground-based observers may wish to wait for Earth
    to leave the focal plane on 2017-Dec-11 near 6h UT to
    commence their complementary observations.
    By this time, the mission's engineers will also have been
    able to confirm the accuracy of Kepler's pointing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Earth and Moon will be captured by the first Full Frame Image (FFI),
    which is scheduled for 2017-Dec-10 between 21:38 and 22:08 UT.
    In addition, a narrow custom LC mask will cover Earth's trajectory
    between 2017-Dec-07 17:00 and 2017-Dec-08 03:00 UT,
    which is when Earth will occult the Moon as seen from Kepler.
    Don't forget to smile and wave towards the constellation of Capricornus
    near these times, which is where Kepler will be located while it is
    observing our planet!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="k2-fields.html"&gt;fields of these campaigns&lt;/a&gt; 
will cover roughly 100 square degrees each towards the
constellations of Virgo (C17), Cancer (C18), and Aquarius/Pisces (C19).
To help inspire observing proposals,
we offer below a list of notable targets that will be visible
during these campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="max-width: 400px; float:right; padding:2em;"&gt;
&lt;a href="images/k2/k2-c17-field.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Figure: position of field 17." class="img-responsive" src="images/k2/k2-c17-field.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="campaign-17"&gt;Campaign 17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign 17 (Mar 1 - May 8, 2018) will observe a forward-facing field
located towards the constellation of Virgo.
The high galactic latitude of this field (+55°) makes it ideally suited
to survey a large number of galaxies for the &lt;a href="supernova-experiment"&gt;K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment&lt;/a&gt;.
The field also provides a substantial overlap with Campaign 6,
offering a longer baseline for stellar activity, asteroseismology, and AGN studies,
as well as enabling dozens of known K2 planet candidates to be revisited.
The field also provides access to ~20 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of previously unexplored sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable objects which may be proposed include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spica"&gt;Spica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (V=1): the brightest star in the constellation of Virgo, known to be a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_ellipsoidal_variable"&gt;rotating ellipsoidal variable&lt;/a&gt; with a period of four days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EQ_Virginis"&gt;EQ Virginis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (V=9): a bright K-type flare star.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K2-41, K2-99, K2-110&lt;/strong&gt;: stars hosting confirmed planets discovered during K2 Campaign 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RX_J1347.5-1145"&gt;RX J1347.5-1145&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: one of the most massive galaxy clusters known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br style="clear: both;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Figure: position of field 18 relative to fields 5 and 16." class="img-responsive" src="images/k2/k2-c18-field.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="campaign-18"&gt;Campaign 18&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign 18 (May 12 - Aug 2, 2018) will observe a backward-facing campaign dedicated to revisit Campaign 5 and substantially overlap Campaign 16.
The third visit to this key part of the sky that contains the M44 and M67 
clusters will enable users to study benchmark targets with a 3-year baseline and 8-month duty cycle, enabling original Kepler-like science
at a Galactic sightline that is located 130 degrees away from the original Kepler field in Cygnus.
The field also provides access to more than one hundred previously-published K2 planets and planet candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable objects which may be proposed include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M67&lt;/strong&gt;: the benchmark open cluster with solar-like age and metallicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M44&lt;/strong&gt; (aka Praesepe or the Beehive): a 600 Myr-old open cluster revealed by K2 Campaign 5 to contain several planets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIP 41378&lt;/strong&gt; (V=9): a bright F-type dwarf previously discovered by K2 to host at least 5 planets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K2-34, K2-95, K2-97, K2-98, K2-100, K2-101, K2-102, K2-103, K2-104, K2-105, K2-108, K2-114, K2-115&lt;/strong&gt;: additional stars hosting confirmed K2 planets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OJ_287"&gt;OJ 287&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (V=15): a well-studied galaxy thought to show lightcurve variations due to a binary supermassive black hole at its center.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="campaign-19"&gt;Campaign 19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign 19 (Aug 6 - Oct 10, 2018) will observe a forward-facing field near the constellation of Aquarius, partially overlapping Campaigns 3 and 12,
while also providing access to ~15 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of previously unstudied sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable objects which may be proposed include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neptune&lt;/strong&gt;: the planet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRAPPIST-1&lt;/strong&gt; (V=19): the well-known M dwarf known to host 7 Earth-sized planets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GJ 9827&lt;/strong&gt; (V=10): a K-type dwarf &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01527"&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01957"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; to host at least three transiting planets near the rocky/gaseous divide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_217107"&gt;HD 217107&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (V=6): a bright G-type subgiant known to host two large RV planets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comet 2P/Encke&lt;/strong&gt; (V=20): a well-known periodic comet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="other-candidate-targets"&gt;Other candidate targets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the highlights listed above, Simbad lists a wealth of known objects that will be visible during these Campaigns. They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;28,857 Galaxies;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1,979 known M dwarfs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;799 High Proper-Motion stars;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;616 White Dwarfs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;462 RR Lyr Variables;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;310 Active Galactic Nuclei;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;204 (candidate) Brown Dwarfs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;44 Flare Stars;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;21 Cataclysmic Variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full table containing all Simbad sources that are visible in C17-18-19
can be downloaded from this website in CSV format (&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeplerGO/K2FootprintFiles/master/simbad/K2-C17-C19-Simbad.csv"&gt;K2-C17-C19-Simbad.csv&lt;/a&gt;) or as a VOTable (&lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2FootprintFiles/raw/master/simbad/K2-C17-C19-Simbad.xml.gz"&gt;K2-C17-C19-Simbad.xml.gz&lt;/a&gt;). Beware however that Simbad is not a full catalog of all known sources; it merely lists objects that have previously been discussed in the literature.
For the purpose of e.g. color-based target selections,
we recommend using a more complete source catalog such as the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php"&gt;EPIC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, the &lt;a href="software.html#k2fov"&gt;K2fov Python package&lt;/a&gt; enables you to test whether targets fall within a campaign field,
while its sister &lt;a href="software.html#k2ephem"&gt;K2ephem package&lt;/a&gt;
allows moving Solar System bodies to be checked.
Note that Campaigns 17-18-19 require K2fov version 7.0 or higher to be installed.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>First version of the K2 Handbook now available</title><link href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/first-version-of-the-k2-handbook-now-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-25T12:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-09-25T12:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Jeff Coughlin</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2017-09-25:/first-version-of-the-k2-handbook-now-available.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first version of the K2 Handbook has been released and is

&lt;h3 id="new-two-phase-process"&gt;New two-phase process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because spacecraft fuel is expected to run out during one of these Campaigns,
the Cycle 6 call will use a new two-phase submission and
target selection process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An optional &lt;strong&gt;Phase-1&lt;/strong&gt; proposal, for all three campaigns (17-19) combined, will enable &lt;strong&gt;targets&lt;/strong&gt; to be selected ahead of the observing campaigns.
Phase-1 proposals, including target lists and a scientific rationale,
are requested by &lt;strong&gt;October 12, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;
and must be submitted via email to keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov.
The scientific rationale must not exceed 2 pages for small programs
(less than 1000 targets) and 4 pages for large programs
(1000 targets or more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the spacecraft health and fuel allow,
then &lt;strong&gt;Phase-2&lt;/strong&gt; proposals for &lt;strong&gt;funding&lt;/strong&gt; will be due &lt;strong&gt;April 19, 2018&lt;/strong&gt; (via NSPIRES).
Phase-2 proposals are limited to use observations for targets which have
been selected as part of Phase-1, the selection results of which will
be published in February 2018.
Phase-2 proposals are eligible to receive funding awards
between $30K and $150K, depending on the number of targets used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revised process allows the allocation of funding to be postponed until after the successful start of Campaign 17 is confirmed in April 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Phase-1 and Phase-2 proposals will be peer-reviewed and ranked by professional volunteers.
The ranking of Phase-1 proposals will only inform the target selection, while
the ranking of Phase-2 proposals will only inform the allocation of funding.
Submission of the Phase-1 proposals does not obligate proposers to submit a Phase-2 proposal (the latter will normally only be of interest to US-based investigators that are eligible to receive funding.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information about the proposal process, including the scope,
evaluation criteria, availability of funds, eligibility,
target selection tools, submission process, and frequently asked questions, is detailed on the &lt;a href="/k2-proposing-targets.html"&gt;proposal preparation page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="k2fov-update-required"&gt;K2fov update required&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="fields-selected-for-k2-campaigns-17-18-and-19.html"&gt;final field positions for Campaigns 17-19
have recently been set&lt;/a&gt;
based on community input.
All investigators &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; update their version of the
&lt;a href="software.html#k2fov"&gt;K2fov target selection tool&lt;/a&gt;
to version 7.0, released on 16 June 2017,
to take the final field positions into account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2fov can be updated from the command line using pip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pip install K2fov --upgrade --no-deps
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The version number of your K2fov installation may be verified
using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;import K2fov; print(K2fov.__version__)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This should return "7.0.0" or higher. If the number is lower,
or if you see an error message, then your installation of K2fov is outdated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder: the "forward-facing" Campaign 16 field
will be &lt;strong&gt;visible from both hemispheres throughout the duration of the Campaign (Dec 7 - Feb 25)&lt;/strong&gt;,
enabling contemporaneous observations to be carried out from observatories on Earth. Many teams have already registered their contemporaneous observing plans in &lt;a href="share-your-plan-for-k2-campaign-16-ancillary-observations.html"&gt;a publicly editable Google Doc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plans submitted so far have been compiled into the map below,
revealing a wide range of observing capabilities which are expected to yield
a rich legacy data set that is likely to benefit a wide variety of investigations.
Several of the observatories plan to monitor the C16 field every night,
providing polychromatic photometry and spectroscopy to complement Kepler's single bandpass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to encourage the K2 community to continue to &lt;a href="share-your-plan-for-k2-campaign-16-ancillary-observations.html"&gt;register
the details of the observing efforts in the Google Doc&lt;/a&gt;,
and to engage in collaborations which help optimize the use of the available resources.&lt;/p&gt;

both spacecraft systematics and stellar variability at the same time.
Version 2.0 incorporates Campaigns 7, 8, and 10 for the first time,
includes a re-processing of Campaigns 3-6,
and fixes the "cadence" and "quality" columns which were affected by a glitch in version 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of July, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sff/"&gt;K2 Self-Flat-Fielding (K2SFF)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; light curves prepared by &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PASP..126..948V"&gt;Vanderburg &amp;amp; Johnson&lt;/a&gt; have been updated.
The K2SFF algorithm correlates flux measurements
with the spacecraft's pointing to remove the motion-induced systematics.
The latest update adds Campaign 11 light curves to the existing set which already included Campaigns 0 through 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of March, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/polar/"&gt;Planet candidates from OptimaL Aperture Reduction (POLAR)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; light curves and planet candidates prepared by &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...594A.100B"&gt;Barros et al.&lt;/a&gt; have been made available for Campaigns 1 through 6.
POLAR is a new product optimized for bright stars
which are suitable for spectroscopic follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of February, version 2.0 of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/everest/"&gt;EPIC Variability Extraction and Removal for Exoplanet Science Targets (EVEREST)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; light curves was released.
The update, detailed in &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1702.05488"&gt;Luger et al. (2017)&lt;/a&gt;,
provides light curves for Campaigns 0 through 8,
and includes short cadence and saturated targets for the first time.
EVEREST uses a pixel-level detrending model which is asserted to offer a photometric performance similar to that of Kepler's main mission for stars down to Kp=14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details on each of these data products, including a more detailed description and a list of references, is available via the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/hlsps.html"&gt;K2 High Level Science Product page at MAST&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional teams are encouraged to make their bespoke data products available
in the same way.
In particular, PI's of large programs funded via the K2 Guest Observer Program
are reminded of the requirement to develop and disseminate a value-added community resource product at the end of their performance period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="helpdesk.html"&gt;project's helpdesk&lt;/a&gt; is available
to help guide the delivery of new data products
and connect authors with the archives.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Recorded talks from Kepler &amp; K2 SciCon IV now available online</title><link href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/recorded-talks-from-kepler-k2-scicon-iv-now-available-online.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-14T14:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-08-14T14:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Knicole Colon</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2017-08-14:/recorded-talks-from-kepler-k2-scicon-iv-now-available-online.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Kepler &amp;amp; K2 Science Conference IV was held

and &lt;b&gt;119 standard short cadence&lt;/b&gt; stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Notable targets include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    The outskirts of the ~11 Myr-old &lt;b&gt;Upper Sco&lt;/b&gt; region, the most nearby OB star association (400 light-years away), including:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;Delta Sco&lt;/b&gt;: one of the best-studied Be-type stars, known for outbursts in 2000 and 2011. The target is very bright (Kp=2) and thus observed using a custom circular mask (ID 200194910).
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Several other &lt;b&gt;bright B- and A-type stars&lt;/b&gt; (Kp=4-6) to be searched for pulsations for the first time.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Hundreds of &lt;b&gt;low-mass pre-main sequence stars&lt;/b&gt;.
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    Targets being observed in short cadence include:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;GW Lib&lt;/b&gt;: a cataclysmic variable with a white dwarf that pulsates (ID 249251294).
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;2MASS 1507-1627&lt;/b&gt;: an L5-type Brown Dwarf located just 24 light-years from Earth (ID 249914869).
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;b&gt;K2-38&lt;/b&gt;: an exoplanet system with two transiting super-Earths discovered in K2 Campaign 2 (ID 204221263).
        &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    The &lt;b&gt;globular cluster NGC 5897&lt;/b&gt; is being observed using a 90-by-90 pixel square box (IDs 200194922–200194957).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;3466 Galaxies&lt;/b&gt; are being monitored for supernovae.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;38 Solar System objects&lt;/b&gt;, including:
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            Asteroid Ryugu: target of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayabusa_2"&gt;Hyabusa 2&lt;/a&gt; sample return mission (IDs 200194922–200194787).
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            3 Main-belt asteroids: Fantasia, Neujmina, and Stereoskopia.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            4 Comets: 94P/Russell, 130P/McNaught-Hughes, C/2014 F3 (Sheppard-Trujillo), and C/2014 W2 (PANSTARRS).
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
            16 Jupiter Trojans and 14 Trans-Neptunian Objects.

The data provide photometry and centroid positions for 95 guide stars that were used to keep the spacecraft pointing stable; 44 unique guide stars were observed during Kepler's prime mission and 51 during K2 Campaigns 0 through 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guide stars were observed by four dedicated sensors in the corners of the focal plane, which collected photometry at a cadence of 0.104 seconds. An irregularly-sampled subset of the data were downlinked to Earth for engineering purposes. These have now been unearthed from the telemetry to enable the scientific value to be assessed by the community. The figure below illustrates the sampling cadence. Note that Quarters 0, 1 and 2 were more sparsely sampled than later periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Campaign 17&lt;/b&gt; (Mar 1 - May 8, 2018) will observe a forward-facing field
toward the constellation of Virgo.
The high galactic latitude of this field makes it ideally suited
to enable the &lt;a href="supernova-experiment"&gt;K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment&lt;/a&gt; to continue, leveraging ground-based resources already put in place for Campaign 16.
The field also provides a substantial overlap with Campaign 6,
offering a longer baseline for stellar activity, asteroseismology, and AGN studies,
as well as enabling dozens of known K2 planet candidates to be revisited.
The field also provides access to ~20 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of previously unexplored sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Campaign 18&lt;/b&gt; (May 12 - Aug 2, 2018) will be a backward-facing campaign dedicated to revisit Campaign 5 and substantially overlap Campaign 16.
The third visit to this key part of the sky that contains the M44 and M67
clusters will enable users to study benchmark targets with a 3-year baseline and 8-month duty cycle, enabling "original Kepler mission"-like science
at a Galactic sightline that is located 130 degrees away from the original Kepler field in Cygnus.
Alongside M44 and M67, the field provides access to HIP 41378 (a 5-planet system around a 9th magnitude star),
and more than one hundred previously-published K2 planet candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Campaign 19&lt;/b&gt; (Aug 6 - Oct 10, 2018) will observe a forward-facing field near the constellation of Aquarius, partially overlapping Campaigns 3 and 12,
plus providing access to ~15 deg&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of previously unstudied sky.
The field includes the planet Neptune, Comet 2P/Encke, and the Trappist-1 system and the forward-facing orientation facilitates simultaneous ground observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;These fields will constitute K2's GO Cycle 6.
A call for target and funding proposals to be submitted to this Cycle
is expected to be issued in July as part of the NASA ROSES program,
with a Step-1 deadline expected to fall in October.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following graphs illustrate the exact field placement:&lt;/p&gt;

the spacecraft observed 33,424 stars in a dither pattern
for the purpose of measuring the Pixel Response Function (PRF).
The pattern consisted of 122 pointings, each with a
duration of 14.7 minutes,
observed across a 2.5-day period on April 27-29, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PRF inferred from these data was previously released
in the form of FITS files which provide PRF images
for the four corners and the center of each CCD channel.
These files have been available from the Kepler data archive's
&lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/fpc.html"&gt;Focal Plane Characteristics page&lt;/a&gt; for several years, and their construction was detailed in a paper by &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...713L..97B"&gt;Bryson et al. 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dithered data from which the PRF was inferred was hitherto unavailable.
As part of an ongoing effort to unearth all useful data
before the end of the mission,
these cadences have been processed into Target Pixel Files
and are now available &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/kepler/commissioning_prfs/"&gt;from the data archive at MAST&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.
They may be of use to anyone wishing to investigate Kepler's intra- and
inter-pixel variations.
Details of this release are described in document &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/KSCI-19100-001.pdf"&gt;KSCI-19100&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animation below shows example data obtained as part of the dither sequence.
The graph elucidates the dither pattern (Figure 3 from &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...713L..97B"&gt;Bryson et al. 2011&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

Although these future Campaigns are at risk of not being executed
due to Kepler running low on fuel,
there is a significant chance that the spacecraft will continue to function
well into 2018 and the project must be ready to observe fields accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strive to optimize these future fields based on potential science.
We are now soliciting feedback from the community on the
placement of fields 17 and 18.
Example options which satisfy K2's pointing constraints are shown below.
When submitting your input, please keep in mind
that we can only shift the field along the ecliptic between these options,
not up or down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We ask that all requests for field placements be received by
April 11 and be &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJ9hfrCBbRKsbHF-0cMO-orQMaijXnC_5pHfezp29Q81wFPg/viewform?usp=sf_link"&gt;submitted via this Google Form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
Advocacy that was submitted in recent months via e-mail
will be taken into account as well.
We anticipate announcing the final field positions in early May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="campaign-17-example-forward-facing-options"&gt;Campaign 17: Example forward-facing options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign 17 is designated to have a forward-facing field
to enable simultaneous observations from the Earth.
Possible field options are outlined in the table below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that all options have a start date of 3 March 2018,
i.e. 5 days after the end of Campaign 16.
The first option is very short in duration
due to its partial overlap in observing geometry with C16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The field for Campaign 18 largely depends on the location of the Campaign
17 field as well as whether or not Campaign 18 will be posited as a
forward-facing or backward-facing field. If we allow Campaign 18 to begin 5 days after the end of
each of the three options for Campaign 17 noted above, then we obtain
the following options listed below in the case of a forward-facing field:&lt;/p&gt;

* C9 was the microlensing experiment where pixels were primarily collected
  around the Galactic bulge. Therefore, the distribution of targets
  across modules was not uniform in that campaign.

  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And these are the C18 options for the backward-facing geometry,

These are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the project's true data products:
by late May, the routine pipeline processing of the K2 data will be completed
and vetted, and the fully calibrated data made available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage our community to share their
understanding of the raw data with the public by blogging or tweeting
tutorials and analyses.
This public TRAPPIST-1 data set offers a unique opportunity
to let a wider audience witness the process scientific discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remainder of this blog post summarizes the caveats
associated with the raw data,
describes the availability of preliminary Target Pixel Files,
and offers a quick-look at the TRAPPIST-1 light curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="raw-data-caveats"&gt;Raw data caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the raw, uncalibrated data files requires an intimate understanding
of their format and caveats.
In particular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the raw data are not flat-fielded, bias-subtracted, or smear-corrected;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cadences of poor quality, e.g. due to thruster firings, are not flagged;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the data are formatted in a non-standard way
and &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/kadenza"&gt;require reformatting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, during Campaign 12, a cosmic ray event reset
the spacecraft's onboard software causing a five-day break
in science data collection from Feb 1st through Feb 6th.
The benign event is the fourth occurrence of a cosmic ray susceptibility
since launch in March 2009 and the spacecraft remains healthy
and operating nominally otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pseudo-target-pixel-files"&gt;Pseudo Target Pixel Files&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRAPPIST-1 was observed
using a 11x11 short-cadence mask with EPIC ID 200164267
from Dec 15th, 2016, through Mar 4th, 2017.
To help the community explore this target,
the Guest Observer Office reformatted the raw data into a
&lt;em&gt;pseudo&lt;/em&gt; Target Pixel Files
using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/kadenza"&gt;Kadenza tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The files are available for download from Zenodo
(DOI &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.375796"&gt;10.5281/zenodo.375796&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long cadence: &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/375796/files/k2-trappist1-unofficial-tpf-long-cadence.fits.gz"&gt;k2-trappist1-unofficial-tpf-long-cadence.fits.gz&lt;/a&gt; (2 MB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short cadence: &lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/record/375796/files/k2-trappist1-unofficial-tpf-short-cadence.fits.gz"&gt;k2-trappist1-unofficial-tpf-short-cadence.fits.gz&lt;/a&gt; (45 MB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to traditional Target Pixel Files, the FLUX values
in these files are &lt;strong&gt;not corrected for smear or bias,
and not all header keywords are populated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="quick-look-at-trappist-1"&gt;Quick look at TRAPPIST-1&lt;/h2&gt;

reveals sinusoidal patterns due to star spots, and at least 6 planets:&lt;/p&gt;

using the &lt;a href="http://barentsen.github.io/k2flix/"&gt;k2flix tool&lt;/a&gt;,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This will change in Campaign 16 (Dec 2017 - Feb 2018),
when K2 will observe in the forward-facing direction
to enable observations in a field
that can easily be accessed from Earth at the same time.
This will enable K2's single-bandpass photometry to be
complemented with simultaneous observations from the ground.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help the community secure observing resources for this opportunity
ahead of the upcoming proposal deadlines,
the project has prepared a preliminary list of 16,000 targets which
are planned to be observed during the Campaign.
The list is available as a CSV file (&lt;a href="data/campaigns/c16/k2c16-preliminary-target-list.csv"&gt;k2c16-preliminary-target-list.csv&lt;/a&gt;)
and contains five columns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EPIC ID (empty if not in EPIC);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RA (decimal degrees);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dec (decimal degrees);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kp (magnitude);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programs (pipe-delimited list of program IDs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list does not include short cadence mode, Solar System bodies,
and custom masks (such as M67, the core of which is likely to be observed
using a ~0.5°-by-0.5° super-mask).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final list of ~25,000 targets will be available by Nov 2017
and is expected to include all targets from the preliminary list,
save a small number of targets which prove to be unobservable
due to falling close to the edge of the field of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder: Campaign 16 will run from December 7th, 2017,
through February 25th, 2018.
The field is located at a moderate Galactic Latitude (+35°)
towards the constellation of Cancer (RA 9h, Dec +19°).
The line of sight shows very low foreground extinction (Av ~0.2 mag)
which makes it well-suited for extragalactic
and &lt;a href="supernova-experiment/"&gt;supernova science&lt;/a&gt;.
The field also contains the well-known clusters M44 (Beehive) and M67.&lt;/p&gt;

including &lt;b&gt;Aldebaran&lt;/b&gt; and more than 15 members
of the Hyades,
are being observed using a custom 40-pixel diameter circular aperture mask.
Such circular masks capture the PSF cores while excluding
the long saturation columns which tend to bleed off silicon.
Nine bright Hyades members are also being observed in short cadence

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Support Scientists, Kepler/K2 Science Center&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;NASA Ames Research Center&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Moffett Field, California 94035&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NASA’s Kepler and K2 missions deliver high-precision space-borne photometry which impact all areas of astrophysics in unique and important ways, including exoplanet science, stellar astrophysics, extragalactic physics, and solar system science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kepler/K2 Science Center is seeking to fill multiple staff positions within the Kepler and K2 Guest Observer (GO) Office at NASA’s Ames Research Center.  Responsibilities of the GO Office are to provide an interface between mission operations and the diverse academic community, to help execute and vet new K2 observations, to provide technical support for the scientific exploitation of the data by developing open source software tools, and to support outreach activities.  Details of the GO Office’s activities can be found at keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support Scientists will be encouraged to develop an independent astronomical research program.  Ideally, this research would involve active collaboration with Kepler/K2 community scientists and staff.   The development of synergies between Kepler/K2 science and NASA’s upcoming TESS and JWST missions is particularly encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position is expected to last around 2 years, depending on Kepler’s fuel usage, and may continue thereafter depending on the mission’s close-out funding.  The position comes with a competitive salary for the Silicon Valley area ($95-$115k commensurate with experience) plus health, vision, and dental insurance, and retirement contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualifications: PhD in science or equivalent experience; broad understanding of astronomical and/or exoplanet science; open source software development skills; excellent communication skills.  Additional desirable experience includes familiarity with the Python/AstroPy ecosystem, the GitHub platform, and web development skills.  Experience in a science support role and/or direct experience with Kepler data is beneficial, but not essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These jobs will entail significant travel in support of the Kepler/K2 community.  The positions are funded through a cooperative agreement between NASA and the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute (&lt;a href="http://www.baeri.org"&gt;www.baeri.org&lt;/a&gt;).
To apply send a CV, a list of three references, and a summary of science interests and relevant technical skills (maximum 3 pages for the summary) to &lt;a href="mailto:resumes@baeri.org"&gt;resumes@baeri.org&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;Applications will be reviewed starting February 20, 2017, and will continue to be considered thereafter until March 31, 2017.&lt;/strong&gt;  Applicants should expect to receive a confirmation after submission.&lt;/p&gt;

The astract of the session below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exquisite lightcurves of the Kepler and K2 missions have been an unexpected boon to the field of near-field cosmology. Ages and evolutionary states can now be derived for field red giants, by combining asteroseismology with spectroscopic data. Red giants, far more luminous than the main-sequence turnoff stars usually used, allow us to probe the evolution of the whole Galaxy. Originally these investigations were restricted to a single line of sight of the Kepler field. With the failure of two of the reaction wheels and the start of the K2 program to observe many fields along the ecliptic, we now probe distinctly different Galactic populations, including the inner and outer disks, the bulge-halo interface, and far more of the Galactic halo. In K2, the Galactic Archaeology Program has been awarded the second largest number of targets, with over 50,000 stars targeted to understand the formation of the Milky Way. The data from the Kepler field has already been used to calibrate the largest age map yet made of the Galaxy, and we are just beginning to explore this vast dataset. The ongoing release of Kepler/K2 light curves and the public availability of follow-up spectra for thousands of targets over the last year alone indicates that this is an ideal time to discuss the most recent breakthroughs in the rapidly evolving field of Galactic archeologyIn this special session, we will discuss the extensive follow-up work underway to make Galactic archaeology possible, discuss how Kepler/K2 data in stellar clusters reveals the history of stellar activity, and present the pioneering results of Galactic archaeology. These include investigations of the age spread in the Galactic halo, examination of the vertical and radial age gradients in the thick and thin disk, measurement of the timescales for chemical evolution, calibration of age indicators for even larger age maps, and discussion of synergies with Gaia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained in detail in the &lt;a href="/k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-10"&gt;data release notes&lt;/a&gt;,
the data were processed in two separate sets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first six days of data, dubbed C10a, were collected with a pointing error of 3.3 pixels from the nominal field-of-view, so they were only processed through CAL to make Type 1 target pixel files and collateral data files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The remainder of the campaign, dubbed C10b, was processed through the entire photometry pipeline, creating Type 2 target pixel files, long-cadence light curves, and collateral data files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C10a files are known in the archive under Campaign number 101,
and the C10b files have Campaign number 102.
A search for Campaign 10 will return both sets of files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another complexity is that &lt;a href="/break-in-science-collection-during-k2-campaign-10.html"&gt;Module 4 was lost part way through C10b&lt;/a&gt;,
which powered off the photometer and produced a 14-day data gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Campaign 12 target list includes &lt;b&gt;29,221 standard long cadence&lt;/b&gt;
and &lt;b&gt;141 standard short cadence&lt;/b&gt; targets,
all located in a high-Galactic latitude field (-60&amp;deg;)
on the boundary between the constellations of Aquarius and Pisces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short cadence list includes &lt;b&gt;TRAPPIST-1&lt;/b&gt;,
an ultracool dwarf star known to host
several Earth-sized transiting planets.
A generous 11-by-11 pixel short cadence mask
will be used to capture the target (mask ID 200164267).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long cadence list includes &lt;b&gt;2,576 galaxies&lt;/b&gt; to enable
supernovae and AGN studies.
It also includes &lt;b&gt;8 bright stars&lt;/b&gt; (Kp ~5)
for which we collected only the central region of pixels
using a circular aperture mask, excluding the long saturation bleed.
Their target IDs are:
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;200164168 (83 Aqr)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;200164173 (81 Aqr)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200164174 (HR 8897)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, long cadence custom masks are scheduled to observe
&lt;b&gt;19 Trojan asteroids&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;9 Trans-Neptunian Objects&lt;/b&gt;,
and &lt;b&gt;4 Comets&lt;/b&gt; (90P/Gehrels, 95P/Chiron, 176P/LINEAR, 228P/LINEAR).
The trajectories of these moving bodies have been tiled
using 1xn or nx1 pixel strips.
Most notably, the well-known &lt;b&gt;Centaur 95P/Chiron&lt;/b&gt;
will be observed for the entire duration of the campaign in long cadence
(mask ID range 200164175–200164266)
and for 20 days in short cadence (IDs 200161173–200162430).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the original plan,
the Campaign 12 field was rotated and shifted slightly
in order to &lt;a href='/small-changes-to-campaigns-13-14-and-15.html'&gt;optimize spacecraft stability&lt;/a&gt; and to ensure the visibility of TRAPPIST-1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better compensate for the radiation pressure exerted by one of the
spacecraft's low-gain antennae, these fields have been rotated by 0.365°.
This change minimizes the roll drift rate and
hence optimizes fuel usage and photometric precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change affects less than 1% of the sky area covered and is unlikely
to affect most Cycle 5 proposals.
All users are nevertheless encouraged to update the 
&lt;a href="software.html#k2fov"&gt;K2fov&lt;/a&gt; target selection tool
to version 6.2, released on 14 Nov 2016, which includes the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2fov can be updated from the command line using pip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pip install K2fov --upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The version number of your K2fov installation may be verified
using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;import K2fov; print(K2fov.__version__)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This must return "6.2.0" or higher. If the number is lower, or if you see an error message, then your installation of K2fov is outdated and must be upgraded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign 16 does not require a change due to the use of a different,
forward-facing spacecraft configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survey is called the &lt;strong&gt;K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment&lt;/strong&gt;.
Its aims include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;monitoring &lt;strong&gt;&amp;gt;20,000 galaxies&lt;/strong&gt; to gather a statistical sample of the &lt;strong&gt;best supernovae lightcurves ever obtained&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;catching the critical &lt;strong&gt;first few hours&lt;/strong&gt; of supernovae,
allowing different explosion physics and progenitors to be elucidated;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improving the &lt;strong&gt;calibration of Type Ia supernovae&lt;/strong&gt; for cosmology
by determining the key parameters needed for distance fitting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposals to select and analyze K2 targets for this Campaign are eligible for &lt;strong&gt;funding up to $150,000&lt;/strong&gt;  as part of &lt;a href="/k2-proposing-targets.html"&gt;K2 GO Cycle 5&lt;/a&gt;
(which also accepts proposals from all other areas of astrophysics and planetary science).
&lt;strong&gt;The Step 1 deadline is Nov 3, 2016.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help the supernova community plan the observations and follow-up,
the mission will be hosting a
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="supernova-experiment"&gt;K2 Supernova Cosmology Workshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
on &lt;strong&gt;Feb 14-16, 2017&lt;/strong&gt;,
at NASA Ames in Mountain View, California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motivations for this workshop include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;planning the K2 observations with Kepler/K2 team members;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coordinating the simultaneous, ground-based follow-up observations and proposals;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;preparing the data analysis and interpretation efforts, e.g. informed by the previous supernovae observed by Kepler;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exploring synergies with other space missions, wavelength regions, and  science areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be an unconference-style meeting with a limited number of introductory talks and a strong focus on participant-led breakout sessions. The final day will provide ample time for drafting papers and observing proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2"&gt;MAST archive&lt;/a&gt;. The C9 data release notes
are available &lt;a href="k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-9"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C9 was largely dedicated to a search for gravitational microlensing
events in a region around the Galactic bulge. A variety of other
targets were also observed through the K2 &lt;a href="k2-ddt.html"&gt;Director's Discretionary Target&lt;/a&gt; program.
These include O-type stars,the Kuiper Belt Object Quaoar, and the Lagoon
star-forming region (M8). The complete list of observed targets can
be found &lt;a href="k2-approved-programs.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the unique operations for this campaign, the C9
data release only contains Type-1 target pixel files and does not
include light curves. Also, the campaign was split into two halves (C9a
and C9b), with a data downlink taking place in between C9a and C9b to maximize
data collection capabilities as well as introduce a ~0.6 pixel
offset.  Archive products are therefore identified as being from
either C9a or C9b using the identifier c91 or c92, respectively. We strongly encourage users interested in C9 data
to review the

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="campaign-14"&gt;Campaign 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field 14 (RA 11h, Dec +7°) is located at a moderately high Galactic Latitude (+50°)
towards the constellations of Leo and Sextans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable targets include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M96_Group"&gt;Leo I Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: a group of nearby, bright galaxies that lie within the Local Supercluster. Its members include M95, M96, and M105.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;img alt="Figure: position of field 14." class="img-responsive" src="images/campaign_selected/field14-final.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="campaign-15"&gt;Campaign 15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field 15 (RA 16h, Dec -20°) is located at a moderate Galactic Latitude (+30°)
towards the constellation of Libra.  There is a small overlap with the previous Campaign 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable targets include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upper Sco&lt;/strong&gt;: a young, nearby OB association that was previously observed during C2. It is partially visible again in C15. Notable Upper Sco members that are visible in C15 include:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIP 78530&lt;/strong&gt;: a B-type star known from direct imaging to contain a planet or brown dwarf companion. (V=7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Scorpii"&gt;δ Sco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: a bright, B-type binary. (V=2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33 Lib&lt;/strong&gt;: a bright roAp-type star. (V=7)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="campaign-16"&gt;Campaign 16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field 16 (RA 9h, Dec +19°) is located at a moderate Galactic Latitude (+35°)
towards the constellation of Cancer. About 30% of the field overlaps with the previous Campaign 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field shows very low foreground extinction (Av ~0.2 mag)
which makes it well-suited for extragalactic and supernova science.
This field will be observed in the spacecraft's forward-facing direction, enabling simultaneous observations to be made from the ground
at the cost of having the bright Earth pass through the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable objects include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M44&lt;/strong&gt; (aka Praesepe or the Beehive): a 600 Myr-old open cluster revealed by K2 Campaign 5 to contain several planets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M67&lt;/strong&gt;: a famous, 4 Gyr-old open cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K2-34&lt;/strong&gt;: a known exoplanet host revealed by K2 Campaign 5. (V=11)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Cancri"&gt;Arkushanangarushashutu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: a bright K-type giant, famous for being the star with the longest name. (V=4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the highlights listed above, Simbad lists a wealth of known objects that will be visible during these Campaigns. They include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19208 Galaxies;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6993 Quasars;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1904 M-type stars;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;868 High Proper-Motion stars;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;820 Active Galactic Nuclei;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;533 Planetary Nebulae;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;515 White Dwarfs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;511 RR Lyr Variables;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;296 Symbiotic Stars;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;131 Brown Dwarfs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;75 Blue Stragglers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;64 Cepheids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;28 T Tauri Stars;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;22 Cataclysmic Variables;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 Mira Variables;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 O-type stars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full table containing all Simbad sources that are visible in C14-15-16
can be downloaded from this website in CSV format (&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeplerGO/K2FootprintFiles/master/simbad/K2-C14-C16-Simbad.csv"&gt;K2-C14-C16-Simbad.csv&lt;/a&gt;) or as a VOTable (&lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2FootprintFiles/raw/master/simbad/K2-C14-C16-Simbad.xml.gz"&gt;K2-C14-C16-Simbad.xml.gz&lt;/a&gt;). Beware however that Simbad is not a full catalog of all known sources; it merely lists objects that have previously been discussed in the literature.
For the purpose of e.g. color-based target selections,
we recommend using a more complete source catalog, preferably the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php"&gt;EPIC catalog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, the &lt;a href="software.html#k2fov"&gt;K2fov Python package&lt;/a&gt; enables you to test whether targets fall within a campaign field,
while its sister &lt;a href="software.html#k2ephem"&gt;K2ephem package&lt;/a&gt;
allows moving Solar System bodies to be checked.
Note that it is crucial to use K2fov version 6.0 or higher for Campaigns 14-15-16.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>New forward-facing position of Campaign 16 finalized</title><link href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/new-forward-facing-position-of-campaign-16-finalized.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-23T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-09-23T11:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Tom Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2016-09-23:/new-forward-facing-position-of-campaign-16-finalized.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="change-to-campaign-16-field-position-and-delay-to-go-cycle-5-deadline.html"&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt; that in order to maximize the science return from the remaining fuel, K2 Campaign 16 will now be a forward-facing campaign.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="k2-fields.html"&gt;position of this field&lt;/a&gt; has been finalized. The position was chosen to maximize the number of known low-redshift galaxies, while also enabling the collection of a significant fractions of both M67 and the Beehive cluster (aka Praesepe, M44). The campaign will begin around December 7, 2017 and last approximately 80 days. Campaign 16 has a 30% overlap with the Campaign 5 field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether targets fall on-silicon, all investigators must update their version of the
&lt;a href="software.html#k2fov"&gt;K2fov target selection tool&lt;/a&gt;
 and ensure they are using v6.2 or higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An updated EPIC catalog which includes the new C16 field is available from MAST.
It can be accessed via the 
&lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php"&gt;EPIC query form&lt;/a&gt;
or it can be &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/catalogs.html"&gt;downloaded in full&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadline for Step-1 proposals is November 3 at 23:59 EST.

&lt;p&gt;To provide members of the Rosetta science team with fast access to the data,
the uncalibrated level 1 files for Campaign 10 will be made available immediately after downlink on or near September 26.
They will be accessible from a public directory at

&lt;p&gt;The position of the Campaign 16 field is being changed …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In order to maximize the science return from K2 using the remaining fuel,
the mission has decided to change the position of the field for Campaign 16
and to delay the upcoming K2 Cycle 5 deadline by about a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position of the Campaign 16 field is being changed to facilitate
supernova science. Recent estimates of the remaining fuel on the
Kepler spacecraft indicate that Campaign 17 is at risk. Campaign 17 was
intended to have a primary science focus of supernova science. In
order to enable detailed characterization of supernovae, Campaign
17 would be a forward-facing campaign (much like the C9 microlensing campaign).
Observing in this mode allows for simultaneous observations from K2 and from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to maximize the science return from the K2 mission, we are changing the position of the field for Campaign 16.
Campaign 16 will now involve the Kepler spacecraft observing in the forward-facing direction, and a significant fraction of pixels will
be dedicated to supernova science. The new pointing for Campaign 16
will have significant overlap with the field observed during Campaign 5.
&lt;strong&gt;The final field position will be posted to this website in the near future.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, proposals are currently being solicited for K2 GO Cycle 5, which includes &lt;a href="/k2-fields.html"&gt;Campaigns 14, 15, and 16&lt;/a&gt;.
While Campaign 16 will be partially dedicated to supernova science, proposals covering all other areas of astrophysics and planetary science are still encouraged for Campaign 16. 
In particular, we encourage K2 observations that can benefit from simultaneous observations from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these changes to the Campaign 16 field, the
Step 1 and Step 2 proposal deadlines have been revised.
&lt;strong&gt;Step 1 proposals are now due by 23:59 EST 3 November 2016, and Step 2 proposals are due by 23:59 EST 15 December 2016.&lt;/strong&gt;
Investigators may not submit a Step 2 proposal without first submitting a Step 1 proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposers should only propose for  targets that are on active silicon in the updated Campaign 16  field. All investigators must update their version of the
&lt;a href="software.html#k2fov"&gt;K2fov target selection tool&lt;/a&gt;

have now been posted on the &lt;a href="k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-11"&gt;approved targets &amp;amp; programs page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C11 target list includes &lt;b&gt;14,209 standard long cadence&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;65 standard short cadence&lt;/b&gt; targets.
The number of targets is lower than usual because it is a function of the spacecraft's on-board compression efficiency, which is low in the crowded Galactic Bulge field targeted by this Campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We gained efficiency by tiling &lt;b&gt;five globular clusters—M9, M19, NGC 6293, NGC 6355, and Terzan 5&lt;/b&gt;—which contained a high density of targets requested by multiple programs.
The latter three clusters will be observed using a circular aperture with 1.6' radius, whilst M9 was targeted using a 2' radius aperture, and M19 will be targeted using a 3'-by-5' rectangular aperture because it fell only partially on silicon.
Each cluster was tiled using a series of masks with the following ID ranges:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200126982–200127109 (M9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200126870–200126870 (M19)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200127326–200127413 (NGC 6293)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200127414–200127501 (NGC 6355)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128019–200128100 (Terzan 5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target list also includes &lt;b&gt;11 very bright stars&lt;/b&gt; (Kp magnitudes 3 to 6) for which we target only the central region of pixels using a circular aperture mask, excluding the long saturation bleed.
Two of the bright stars are observed in short cadence (26 Oph &amp;amp; 36 Oph) and
the others in long cadence. Their target IDs are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200129034 (26 Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200129035 (36 Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128906 (θ Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128907 (44 Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128908 (45 Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128909 (51 Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128910 (ο Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128911 (HR 6472)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128912 (HR 6365)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128913 (HR 6366)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128914 (191 Oph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will also observe &lt;b&gt;55 Trojan asteroids&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;7 Trans-Neptunian Objects&lt;/b&gt;, and Saturn's moons &lt;b&gt;Titan and Enceladus&lt;/b&gt;.
The trajectories of these moving bodies have been tiled using 1xn or nx1 pixel strips. The ID ranges for these objects are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200107039–200128905 (Trojans)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200114742–200125326 (TNOs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200128938–200129033 (Titan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200124091–200124403 (Enceladus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is the first campaign to be executed after the &lt;a href='/retirement-of-ccd-module-4-confirmed.html'&gt;loss of CCD Module 4&lt;/a&gt;.
Targets that were approved but would have fallen on this module were excluded from the target list.
Only five programs lost more than 10% of their targets as a result,
and no program lost more than 20%.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Changes to Kepler and K2 Project Scientist personnel</title><link href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/changes-to-kepler-and-k2-project-scientist-personnel.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-08T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-09-08T11:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Tom Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2016-09-08:/changes-to-kepler-and-k2-project-scientist-personnel.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There have been personnel changes at the Kepler and K2 Project Scientist role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/kepler/kepler-mission-manager-update-photometer-update"&gt;the latest Kepler Mission Manager Update&lt;/a&gt;,
additional spacecraft telemetry appears to confirm the loss of CCD Module 4
during K2's current Campaign 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Module 4 is the third of the 21 science modules to have failed in-flight.
Such hardware failures were foreseen in the initial mission planning, and the system design is robust and compartmentalized to minimize the impacts. After more than seven years in the harsh conditions of space, 85 percent of Kepler's original detectors are still operating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign 10 science observations &lt;a href="/break-in-science-collection-during-k2-campaign-10.html"&gt;were interrupted between July 20 and August 3&lt;/a&gt;
as a result of the anomaly.
Observations have since returned to normal
and no further interruptions are expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="impact-on-go-programs"&gt;Impact on GO programs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the K2 mission’s current Campaign 10, the targets that fell on Module 4 &lt;a href="/break-in-science-collection-during-k2-campaign-10.html"&gt;will yield no data beyond July 20&lt;/a&gt;.
For all campaigns going forward, we will only allocate pixels to targets which fall on one of the remaining 18 operational modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average 4% of the targets requested by selected GO programs fell on the retired Module, with no single program affected by more than 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pixel storage budget that would have been used by Module 4 during future Campaigns will be re-allocated to other Modules, allowing the total number of
K2 targets to remain unchanged.
The impact on science is expected to be small as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the high-profile targets in future Campaigns, such as Trappist-1 or Comet Chiron, are known to be affected.
Investigators who are concerned about a particular target are encouraged to contact us at &lt;a href="keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov"&gt;keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="where-is-module-4"&gt;Where is Module 4?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ill-fated Module is located on the outside of the focal plane,
where both the pointing stability and the point spread function are less ideal.
Its position is marked using a pen in the photograph below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial line of sight pointing of the spacecraft at the start of the campaign was offset from its intended target by 12 arcsec, sufficient to lose much of the expected target light from the assigned apertures. This error was compounded by a downlink issue that failed to provide the requisite focal plane data that is intended to catch such errors. These data were subsequently acquired and pointing corrected on July 13.  Although the spacecraft was in fine point throughout, the pointing offset will compromise much of the data for the first week of observations, and is likely to more seriously affect those targets near the edge of the focal plane where roll is largest.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on July 20, the photometers was turned off as an apparent response to a failure of a module on the focal plane. The spacecraft otherwise continued to operate normally, and the anomaly was not discovered until a scheduled data downlink on July 28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With extremely poor communication geometry at science attitude, spacecraft health checks consume significant DSN resources, requiring a 70-meter antenna.  Such health checks are therefore performed infrequently during the K2 mission, roughly every two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the cause of this is yet to be confirmed, the observables are in family with those seen in conjunction with the failure of science CCD Modules 3 and 7 in 2010 and 2014.  Further, thermal data retrieved from the spacecraft are strongly suggestive of a drop in power dissipated by Module 4 that is again in family with a similar drop when Modules 3 and 7 failed.  Thus there is a strong likelihood that Module 4 is no longer functioning.  If this is indeed the case, this would leave us with 18 remaining science modules of the initial 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We undertook a recovery which involved reorienting the spacecraft to attain higher data rate communications with Earth and carefully powering on the various components that had been switched off, and science observations resumed on August 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the thermal data, the Campaign 11 target apertures located on Module 4 are being reassigned to targets on other modules.  We anticipate being able to confirm the health of the suspect module at the next planned health check on August 11 and further updates will be provide thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events like this module failure are things that happen with an aging spacecraft. For future campaigns we will reallocate pixels to active modules as needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Release of reprocessed short cadence data for K2 Campaigns 3, 4, 5</title><link href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/release-of-reprocessed-short-cadence-data-for-k2-campaigns-3-4-5.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-02T14:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-08-02T14:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Geert Barentsen</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2016-08-02:/release-of-reprocessed-short-cadence-data-for-k2-campaigns-3-4-5.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reprocessed short cadence target pixel files for K2 Campaigns 3, 4, and 5

to version 5.1, released on 14 Aug 2016,
to take the final field positions into account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2fov can be updated from the command line using pip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pip install K2fov --upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The version number of your K2fov installation may be verified
using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;import K2fov; print(K2fov.__version__)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This should return "5.1.0" or higher. If the number is lower,
or if you see an error message, then your installation of K2fov is outdated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the campaign included several custom masks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The planet &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uranus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was observed for roughly a month in short cadence,
and the remaining time in long cadence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four irregular &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uranian satellites&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; were observed in long cadence over a period of one month (Caliban, Sycorax, Prospero, Setebos).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hilda asteroids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; were observed in long cadence (1999 TJ90, 1999TS40, 1999 VG135, 2000 WC140, 2006 UB219, 2007 RY194).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trans-Neptunian Objects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (TNOs) were observed in long cadence (1998 SN165, 2001 QT322, 2003 QW90, 2005 RS43).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The irregular dwarf galaxy &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;IC 1613&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was covered using a 120-by-160 pixel mask.&lt;/li&gt;

permits the submission of proposals for work on Kepler/K2 observations
of solar system targets.
The objective of the DDAP program is to enhance the scientific return
of Discovery Program missions by broadening the scientific participation
in the analysis of data, both recent and archived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program intends to fund solar system science.
Proposals using Kepler/K2 observations of objects outside the solar system are not eligible and should be submitted to the Astrophysics Data Analysis Program (ADAP) instead. A non-exhaustive list of K2's solar system targets is given below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because operating in the ecliptic plane minimizes the torque exerted on the spacecraft by solar pressure, the K2 mission entails a series of sequential &lt;a href="k2-fields.html"&gt;observing Campaigns&lt;/a&gt; of fields distributed around the ecliptic.
A result of this observing strategy is that the K2 fields
contain a large number of solar system targets,
which can be observed to provide high-cadence, uninterrupted light curves
to e.g. measure rotation periods, constrain object shapes and spin states,
and search for activity in comets or oscillations in giant planets.
Because Solar System objects move relative to the celestial sphere,
long streaks of pixels are downloaded from the Kepler spacecraft to cover
their trajectory (or part thereof).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="solar-system-targets-in-campaigns-0-15"&gt;Solar system targets in Campaigns 0-15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The K2 mission has so far targeted ~200 solar system objects during
Campaigns 0 through 15 as part of the
&lt;a href="k2-approved-programs.html"&gt;approved observing programs&lt;/a&gt;.
These objects are listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is not exhaustive because thousands of objects are known
to have serendipitously been observed for short periods of time
as they passed through the pixel masks of other targets.
A list of these serendipitously-observed targets is not available at this time,
but note that the visibility of solar system targets in past or future K2 Campaigns
can be checked using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2ephem"&gt;K2ephem command-line tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This algorithm simultaneously models astrophysical variability and pointing systematics, enabling the user to disentangle the two and remove either or both. These light curves are therefore well-suited to searches for transits and other short-lived events in the light curves of variable active stars, or to studying stellar variability.

&lt;p&gt;In Campaign 7 there was a significant drop in the number of targets observed relative to previous campaigns. This drop was because the number of targets we can observe is a function of our on-board compression efficiency. The extremely dense nature of the Campaign 7 field forced us to assume a poorer compression estimate than we used for earlier campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This target list consists of 13,469 standard long cadence and 72 standard short cadence targets. There were also several custom targets.  We tiled a region around the open cluster Ruprecht 147 using 60 individual pixel masks. In addition, we included large pixel masks over 3 Trojan/Hilda Asteroids and the (dwarf) planet Pluto. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled just a subset of the pixels that make up the path the Trojans/Hildas move along. These observations are in long cadence. Finally, we also observed 10 very bright stars by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets but excluding the bleed columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed &lt;a href="/k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-7"&gt;data release notes&lt;/a&gt; are available on the Kepler &amp;amp; K2 Science Center website.  We encourage users to read these carefully; in particular, note that there was an increase in roll drift in Campaign 7 due to the use of an alternate low-gain antenna during science data collection.  This increase in roll motion, combined with an extremely crowded field, impacted the photometry produced by the Kepler pipeline.  Additional details are available in the full data release notes.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Kepler recovered and K2 mission underway again</title><link href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/kepler-recovered-and-k2-mission-underway-again.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-22T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-04-22T11:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Knicole Colon</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2016-04-22:/kepler-recovered-and-k2-mission-underway-again.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Kepler spacecraft has officially been recovered since it was

of a puzzling difference between the short- and long-cadence
calibrated pixel data for a specific K2 target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After investigation, the problem was traced to an accounting error
for the short-cadence collateral smear data.
Under some conditions, these data are passed incorrectly
between the spacecraft and the ground, causing smear values to be
assigned to the wrong columns within a target’s aperture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases, the pipeline’s pixel-level calibration routine
applies an erroneous smear correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="impact"&gt;Impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue has been present since launch and affects both the target pixel
files and the light curves of approximately
half of all short-cadence targets in all releases to date,
i.e. Kepler Data Releases 1-24 and K2 Data Releases for Campaigns 0-5.
A list of all the affected targets is attached below.
The long cadence data for these or other targets is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the smear signal is often small compared to the target signal,
the effect is negligible for many targets.
However, the smear signal is scene-dependent,
so time-varying signals can be introduced into an affected target
by the other stars falling on the same CCD column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the impact on affected targets,
users should inspect the calibrated target pixels
(see Section 2.3.2 of the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/archive_manual.pdf"&gt;Kepler Archive Manual&lt;/a&gt;).
An improperly corrected smear signal may show up as an anomalously bright,
or dark, column in the calibrated target pixel image.
Comparison of the short-cadence pixel image with the long-cadence pixel image
(which is not affected by this problem)
can be used to estimate the magnitude of any contaminating signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kepler pipeline has been amended to ensure that the 
correct smear data is used at all times. 
All affected data will be corrected as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All upcoming K2 data releases will be corrected from the start,
 beginning with Campaign 6. (The release of C6 short cadence data will be delayed by approximately two weeks as a result.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reprocessing of K2 Campaigns 0-5 will occur over the coming months. The expected release dates will be listed here when known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data from the prime Kepler mission will be corrected as part of the scheduled reprocessing with pipeline release 9.3 (DR25). Corrected target pixel files are expected to be available in Summer 2016.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

in the position of Campaigns 11, 12, and 13,
for which target proposals are currently being solicited as part of the
&lt;a href="call-for-k2-go-cycle-4-proposals-for-campaigns-11-12-and-13.html"&gt;K2 Guest Observer Cycle 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change, explained below, alters ~0.2% of sky area covered
and is unlikely to affect the vast majority of proposals.
All users are nevertheless encouraged to update the
&lt;a href="software.html#k2fov"&gt;K2fov&lt;/a&gt; target selection tool
to version 4.0, which was released on 27 Jan 2016 to include the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2fov can be updated from the command line using pip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pip install K2fov --upgrade
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The version number of your K2fov installation may be verified
using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;import pkg_resources; print(pkg_resources.require(&amp;#39;K2fov&amp;#39;)[0].version)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This should return "4.0.0" or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 are being rotated slightly to
accommodate a change in the configuration of the Kepler spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During these Campaigns, spacecraft telemetry will be downlinked
using a different low-gain antenna than before:
&lt;i&gt;LGA2&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;LGA1&lt;/i&gt;.
This antenna provides a better orientation to Earth
and compensates for the increasing range
of the spacecraft to the Earth (now 0.8 AU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change of antenna was recently trialled during Campaign 7,
where it was found to cause a small increase in the roll drift rate.
The reduced pointing performance was understood to be caused
by the antenna's radiation pressure,
which torques the spacecraft slightly differently when &lt;i&gt;LGA2&lt;/i&gt; is used,
increasing the roll rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To optimize fuel usage and photometric precision,
the K2 team has decided to adjust the roll angle
of Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 by a very small amount
(0.12--0.16 degrees) to optimally balance the spacecraft
against solar pressure and antenna radiation
when &lt;i&gt;LGA2&lt;/i&gt; is in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, there is a minor change in the fields of view covered by K2
during these campaigns. The position of the CCD edges
are being shifted by ~0.5 arcsec (~0.1 px) near the center of the
focal plane, and by up to 60 arcsec (~15 px) near the corners.
The change is illustrated in the figure below,
which shows the change in sky coverage for a single CCD channel
near the corner of C11,
where the shift is the most significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="k2-fields.html"&gt;fields of these campaigns&lt;/a&gt;
will cover roughly 100 square degrees at a time near the
constellations of Ophiucus (C11), Aquarius (C12), and Taurus (C13).
All the objects that will be observed during these campaigns must be
requested by the community through the Cycle 4 call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help the community select and propose the most interesting targets,
the Guest Observer Office has prepared a "K2-SIMBAD" catalog which lists all 240,000 objects which appear in the &lt;a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr"&gt;SIMBAD database&lt;/a&gt; and will fall within the fields of future K2 Campaigns.
The catalog details object IDs, spectral types, object classifications, citation counts, proper motions, and selected photometry as recorded in SIMBAD. It can be &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2FootprintFiles/tree/master/simbad"&gt;downloaded in full from our GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The K2-SIMBAD catalog does not replace the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php"&gt;EPIC Input Catalog&lt;/a&gt;, which remains the principal target selection tool. Instead it provides an overview of objects that have appeared in the literature and may hence trigger or inspire K2 Cycle 4 proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we list a selection of notable objects that we encountered in the  catalog, along with interesting Solar System bodies
that will be visible as determined by the &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2ephem"&gt;K2ephem tool&lt;/a&gt;.  This list is not exhaustive by any means and we encourage members of the community to share missing highlights for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

are amenable to observations by the Kepler spacecraft.

&lt;p&gt;Proposals must be accompanied by a &lt;a href="/k2-proposing-targets.html#target-table"&gt;target table&lt;/a&gt; (by the Step 2 deadline) which details the objects
to be observed.
To enable the community to select and propose the most interesting targets,
the following resources are available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (&lt;strong&gt;EPIC&lt;/strong&gt;) has been updated to include targets for Campaigns 11-13. The catalogs can be &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php"&gt;queried online&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/catalogs/"&gt;downloaded in text format&lt;/a&gt; from MAST.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2fov"&gt;K2fov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; package has been updated to include the details of fields 11-12-13, along with the preliminary positions of fields 14 through 17. Installing the package adds two executables to the command line, &lt;em&gt;K2onSilicon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;K2findCampaigns&lt;/em&gt;, which allow the visibility of targets to be checked during one or all campaigns.  If you have a previous version of K2fov installed, it is crucial that you upgrade to version 3.0 or higher ("pip install K2fov --upgrade").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new package called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2ephem"&gt;K2ephem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has been built on top of K2fov to allow the visibility of Solar System bodies, i.e. asteroids and comets, to be checked in a user-friendly way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;sky footprints&lt;/strong&gt; of past and future campaigns have been made available

The problem was traced to an error in the pipeline module that calibrates the pixels, specifically in how it handles the black model calculated by the Dynablack algorithm. As a result, the SC calibrated pixels available in the target pixel files, and the light curves based on these pixels, are excessively noisy.   All DR24 SC data processed by CAL using Dynablack are affected.  In other words, only the SC data from Q0, Q1 and Q17, as well as a few select channels in Q2--Q16, are valid.  Unfortunately, no flag exists in the DR24 data files to indicate whether a target was calibrated using Dynablack.  Users are encouraged to regress to an earlier data release, if they have the required files in their possession (i.e., these earlier releases are no longer available from the MAST archive), or they can wait for the next and final SC data release (DR25).   This calibration problem has been fixed and the final reprocessing is expected to be available in Summer, 2016.  There is no impact on the long-cadence data for either DR24 or DR25.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>K2 Campaign 9 Microlensing Science Team selected</title><link href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-campaign-9-microlensing-science-team-selected.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-11-06T15:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2015-11-06T15:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Knicole Colon</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-11-06:/k2-campaign-9-microlensing-science-team-selected.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/k2-fields.html"&gt;K2 Campaign 9&lt;/a&gt; will be executed in April 2016 and

Campaign 9 microlensing experiment involves the Kepler spacecraft
observing in the +VV direction at fields toward the Galactic
bulge. The aim of this program is to simultaneously observe
gravitational microlensing events with K2 and from Earth in order to
see a parallax effect in the shape and time of the lensing event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microlensing Science Team (MST) was selected through a peer-review
process during K2 GO Cycle 3 by a panel of experts. The aim of the MST
is to both coordinate with and make recommendations to the K2 mission
regarding the best observational methods to use during Campaign 9,
allowing the highest value science return. Additionally, the MST will
serve the interests of the community by, for example, facilitating simultaneous
ground-based data collection, developing novel methods for crowded
field photometry, and providing completeness and reliability studies
of detected microlensing events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MST is comprised of the following people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Bennett (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calen Henderson (JPL/Caltech)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop, called "NASA Planetary Science and Astrophysics Assets," will be held all day on Tuesday, 10 November 2015, in the Azalea 1 room at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between &lt;b&gt;9:00 am and 10:30 am&lt;/b&gt;, the workshop will focus on the K2 mission.
The schedule is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K2 background (15 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Thomas Barclay, NASA Ames&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting solar system bodies (10 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Geert Barentsen, NASA Ames&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K2 support and the ExoFOP (15 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Rachel Akeson, NExScI&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observations of Neptune and Uranus (15 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Amy Simon (NASA GSFC)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushing the limits of K2: observing distant, small Solar System bodies with Kepler (15 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Csaba Kiss (Konkoly Obs., Hungary)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trojan Asteroids (15 min) - &lt;i&gt;Erin Ryan (NASA GSFC)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q&amp;amp;A (5 mins)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fields observed by K2 are close to the ecliptic plane
and rich in solar system objects including planets, asteroids 
and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). 
K2 has already performed observations of Neptune and its large moon Triton, 68 Trojan and Hilda asteroids, 5 TNOs (including Pluto) and Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring). About thousands of main-belt asteroids that fell into the pixel masks of stars have been have been serendipitously observed. Uranus will be observed in a future campaign (C8), as will many more small solar system bodies. Observations of moving bodies as bright as Jupiter and as faint as V=23 have proved successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2 has an ongoing funded Guest Observer program and which has been successfully proposed to by members of the planetary science community. We present K2’s plans and capabilities for solar system science and will have presentations by members of the planetary science community who have used K2 data. This presentation contains information about the mission and its capabilities, discusses the proposal cycles and provides examples, and has community folks talking about their K2 science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage members of the planetary science community interested in using the long-baseline, high-cadence, high-precision photometry provided by the Kepler spacecraft to join the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>K2 Science Conference deadline fast approaching</title><link href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-science-conference-deadline-fast-approaching.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-15T11:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-09-15T11:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-09-15:/k2-science-conference-deadline-fast-approaching.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The September 18 deadline for early registration, hotel reservation, &amp;amp; abstract submission for the &lt;a href="http://lcogt.net/k2scicon/"&gt;K2SciCon&lt;/a&gt; is just a few days away.

Given the proposal review timeline, and associated data processing and archive activities, there can be a significant delay between proposal submission and final target selection for each K2 campaign. To provide a faster mechanism for headline astrophysics with K2 we provide an alternative means for acquiring K2 data, through the Director's Discretionary Target (DDT) program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the DDT program for K2 is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respond to targets of opportunity, e.g. newly discovered exoplanets or supernovae&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yield high-impact science from K2 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance existing GO programs with additional data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DDT program for K2 occurs on a rolling basis; observations can be proposed for at any time starting with targets in Campaign 8. However, to ensure that approved targets are included in the final target lists for each campaign, proposals must be submitted by the following dates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 5, 2015 for Campaign 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December 10, 2015 for Campaign 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 10, 2016 for Campaign 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposals require a 2-page scientific justification and a target table and should be &lt;a href="/k2-ddt.html"&gt;submitted on the DDT page&lt;/a&gt;. The required format as well as a &lt;a href="/k2-proposing-targets.html#target-table"&gt;template for the target table can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. The fixed locations and observing windows of Campaigns 8, 9, and 10 are provided at &lt;a href="/k2-fields.html"&gt;the field information page&lt;/a&gt;. Target overlap with the current GO target list will not be considered unless short cadence observations are being requested of a current long cadence target. DDT proposals will be sent to external reviewers; final selection will be at the discretion of the Guest Observer Office Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to observe several hundred targets through the DDT program, which amounts to a few per cent of the total targets allocated. The exact number of DDTs to be observed largely depends on the number of short versus long cadence DDTs approved. There is no proprietary period and no associated funding for approved DDT programs. Proposals from any institution are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We particularly encourage DDT proposals for Campaign 9, which is a non-standard campaign. The Campaign 9 microlensing experiment involves the Kepler spacecraft observing in the positive velocity vector (+VV) direction at fields toward the Galactic bulge. This allows for simultaneous observations from Earth during Campaign 9. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>K2 Campaign 7 science program available</title><link href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-campaign-7-science-program-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-10T15:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-09-10T15:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-09-10:/k2-campaign-7-science-program-available.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The K2 &lt;a href="k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-7"&gt;Campaign 7 Target List&lt;/a&gt; has now been posted.

In Campaign 7 there was a significant drop in the number of targets observed relative to previous campaigns. This drop was because the number of targets we can observe is a function of our on-board compression efficiency. The extremely dense nature of the Campaign 7 field forced us to assume a poorer compression estimate than we used for earlier campaigns. This target list consists of 13,469 standard long cadence and 72 standard short cadence targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tiled a region around the open cluster Ruprecht 147 using 60 individual pixel masks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we included large pixel masks over 3 Trojan/Hilda Asteroids and the (dwarf) planet Pluto. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled just a subset of the pixels that make up the path the Trojans/Hildas move along. These observations are in long cadence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also observed 10 very bright stars by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets but excluding the bleed columns.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Updated K2 data release schedule</title><link href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/updated-k2-data-release-schedule.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-10T14:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-09-10T14:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-09-10:/updated-k2-data-release-schedule.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The K2 project have updated the dates we expect to release K2 data to the &lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/"&gt;MAST&lt;/a&gt;.

In Campaign 4, 15,853 long cadence and 122 short cadence targets were observed. Additionally, large circular pixel masks were collected that cover bright 3-5 mag B-stars and red giants in the Hyades and Pleiades open clusters.  Data for these nine stars are listed by custom aperture number at MAST, rather than by EPIC number.  A Trans-Neptunian Object (2002 KY14) was also observed, and 1340 pixel masks were collected to cover the trajectory of this moving target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the dust clouds near the Pleiades, the background removal near the cluster has larger than normal residuals. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are &lt;a href="/K2/K2drn/C4/C4_reduced_ap_targets.txt"&gt;887 stellar targets&lt;/a&gt; that have light curves with more noise than expected, as they were likely created with non-optimal apertures.  This is due to incompatibility between K2 roll motion and determination of photometric optimal apertures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fraction (23.8%) of stellar targets have light curves generated from apertures that are larger than optimal because they have lower than expected flux compared to their Kepler magnitudes in the EPIC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A different group of stars have higher than expected flux, also resulting in non-optimal apertures.&lt;/li&gt;

in the data processing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The background level is now removed from the calibrated pixel flux provided
by the target pixel files (column FLUX), bringing the K2 TPF files in line
with those that were previously made available for the prime Kepler mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New quality flags now indicate which cadences were obtained during a thruster firing (column QUALITY).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all results are scientifically significant, there are some that hold the added luster of public appeal. At the basic level, public appeal can be qualified as 'firsts' (the first Earth-sized planet); has a tie to popular culture (Kepler-16b or "Tatooine" and is also a 'first'); or sparks curiosity (catching a supernova before the explosion, or a disintegrating planet). These are the hooks that grab the attention of the public and spurs additional learning. A news hook can be obvious but can require discussion to ferret out the story.&lt;/p&gt;

The cluster was tiled with 73 individual apertures to create a contiguous 400x400 pixel region over two channels.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Additional targets available in future K2 campaigns</title><link href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/additional-targets-available-in-future-k2-campaigns.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-02T05:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-06-02T05:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-06-02:/additional-targets-available-in-future-k2-campaigns.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As some of you prepare your K2 Cycle 3 proposal target lists I wanted to alert you to an increase in the number of targets that we can observe with K2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our pointing has been significantly better than our conservative pointing assumptions we used when we built our pixel cost algorithms. The result of this is that we can observe about double the number of targets from Campaign 5 onwards compared with Campaign 4 and earlier. The increase is from about 15,000 total to around 30,000 total. Unfortunately, the telemetry data to determine that we were able to do this was no available in time for the K2 GO Cycle 2 proposal deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this affect you? You may wish to consider submitting larger target lists than in previous cycles in any Cycle 3 proposals you are submitting. Now, as always there is a caveat here that you should not propose more target than you can justify but please be aware that the cost of a target is now lower.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Due date for K2 Guest Observer Cycle 3 Step-1 proposal fast approaching</title><link href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/due-date-for-k2-guest-observer-cycle-3-step-1-proposal-fast-approaching.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-29T05:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-05-29T05:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-05-29:/due-date-for-k2-guest-observer-cycle-3-step-1-proposal-fast-approaching.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The K2 Guest Observer Cycle 3 proposal call is observations of targets in Campaigns 8 and 10.

&lt;p&gt;Dr Geert Barentsen joins us from the University of Hertfordshire in the UK. Geert's background is in the exploitation of photometry from wide-area surveys. In Hertfordshire he leads the data processing of two projects which aim to map our own Milky Way in unprecedented detail: &lt;a href="http://www.iphas.org"&gt;IPHAS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.vphas.eu"&gt;VPHAS+&lt;/a&gt;. He also teaches a university's programming and statistics class, and is a contributor to the &lt;a href="http://www.astropy.org"&gt;AstroPy&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geert earned his doctorate at the Queen's University of Belfast in 2012 where he studied star formation using narrow-band photometry. Prior to his PhD, he obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Antwerp in Belgium, after which he gained professional experience in data science at the European Space Agency in The Netherlands and the Royal Meteorological Institute in Belgium. In his spare time, he studies the activity of meteor showers using data collected by amateur astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Knicole Colón leaves a postdoctoral role at Lehigh University as a member of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilodegree_Extremely_Little_Telescope"&gt;KELT project&lt;/a&gt; to join us at Kepler. Her expertise is in the discovery and characterization of transiting exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student at the University of Florida, Knicole demonstrated the capability of OSIRIS on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) for exoplanet science.  After earning her doctorate in 2012, she gained postdoctoral experience at the University of Hawaii and Lehigh University.  There, she focused on the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with narrow-band photometry and in the confirmation of planets around bright stars discovered by the KELT transit survey.&lt;/p&gt;

This data was collected between Feb 4-13, 2014, before Campaign 0, and points to a different region of sky to Campaign 0, RA = 359 deg, Dec = -2 deg. In future publications and presentations, we would be grateful if you referred to these data collectively as the "Two-wheel Concept Engineering Test". The motivation for delivering this test data is described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help the community in the endeavor of maximizing photometric quality and precision of a two-wheel mission we have delivered &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/k2/eng/"&gt;engineering data to the MAST archive&lt;/a&gt;. The Kepler spacecraft operated with fine-guidance, collecting data from 2,017 target masks. The properties and quality of the data therein is expected to be similar to those collected during Campaign 0 and provide an excellent opportunity for scientists to make an early and impactful start upon their investigations. Note also that the chances of there being undiscovered planet transits in this engineering set are high and the potential for other serendipitous science is great. To this end we have also provided lists of &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/k2/eng/K2_E2_targets_lc.csv"&gt;long cadence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/k2/eng/K2_E2_targets_sc.csv"&gt;short cadence&lt;/a&gt; targets with a brief description of why each was observed during the test. For those investigators eager to develop this test data scientifically and those investigators with the enthusiasm to develop new technical solutions for two-wheel photometry, we encourage you to dive wholeheartedly into this data set. A typical file size for one of these target pixel files is 26 MB. The Kepler Science Center will not support this engineering data with future reprocessings, deliveries or new products. However the Kepler Science Center will support questions through the helpdesk regarding this data set on a best-effort basis.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
