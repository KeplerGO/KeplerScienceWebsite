The Campaign 8 target list includes 24187 standard long cadence and 54 short cadence targets. The planet Uranus will be observed for roughly a month in short cadence and the remaining time in long cadence, in addition four of its moons make the long cadence target list. Six Trojan asteroids and four TNOs round out the solar system targets.
The irregular dwarf galaxy IC 1613 will be observed with a large pixel mask and several very bright stars will be targeted using custom pixel masks that only collect the wings of the PSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All programs now include a list the number of targets observed as part of that program. Programs from previous campaigns also now have this information included. We encourage PIs from previous campaigns to check the &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-approved-programs.html"&gt;list of approved programs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Presenting results at AAS that have public appeal?

The prime Kepler mission also continues to yield scientifically significant results from its four-year-long observations of the Cygnus-Lyra region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we consider each scientific result to be critical to the legacy of both Kepler and K2, some results are of particular interest to the public (e.g., an exoplanet orbiting in the habitable zone of a nearby star, or stars with unique flux variations that spark a public conversation on alien megastructures). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are attending AAS in January and presenting new results from either K2 or Kepler that you think will grab the public's attention, let us know so we can help promote your work.

The problem was traced to an error in the pipeline module that calibrates the pixels, specifically in how it handles the black model calculated by the Dynablack algorithm. As a result, the SC calibrated pixels available in the target pixel files, and the light curves based on these pixels, are excessively noisy.   All DR24 SC data processed by CAL using Dynablack are affected.  In other words, only the SC data from Q0, Q1 and Q17, as well as a few select channels in Q2--Q16, are valid.  Unfortunately, no flag exists in the DR24 data files to indicate whether a target was calibrated using Dynablack.  Users are encouraged to regress to an earlier data release, if they have the required files in their possession (i.e., these earlier releases are no longer available from the MAST archive), or they can wait for the next and final SC data release (DR25).   This calibration problem has been fixed and the final reprocessing is expected to be available in Summer, 2016.  There is no impact on the long-cadence data for either DR24 or DR25.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>K2 Campaign 9 Microlensing Science Team Selected</title><link href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-campaign-9-microlensing-science-team-selected.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-11-06T15:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Knicole Colon</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-11-06:k2-campaign-9-microlensing-science-team-selected.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-fields.html"&gt;K2 Campaign 9&lt;/a&gt; will be executed in April 2016 and
will be dedicated to a study of gravitational microlensing events. The
Campaign 9 microlensing experiment involves the Kepler spacecraft
observing in the +VV direction at fields toward the Galactic
bulge. The aim of this program is to simultaneously observe
gravitational microlensing events with K2 and from Earth in order to
see a parallax effect in the shape and time of the lensing event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microlensing Science Team (MST) was selected through a peer-review
process during K2 GO Cycle 3 by a panel of experts. The aim of the MST
is to both coordinate with and make recommendations to the K2 mission
regarding the best observational methods to use during Campaign 9,
allowing the highest value science return. Additionally, the MST will
serve the interests of the community by, for example, facilitating simultaneous
ground-based data collection, developing novel methods for crowded
field photometry, and providing completeness and reliability studies
of detected microlensing events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MST is comprised of the following people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Bennett (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calen Henderson (JPL/Caltech)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Hogg (New York University)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Q&amp;amp;A (5 mins)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fields observed by K2 are close to the ecliptic plane
and rich in solar system objects including planets, asteroids 
and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). 
K2 has already performed observations of Neptune and its large moon Triton, 68 Trojan and Hilda asteroids, 5 TNOs (including Pluto) and Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring). About thousands of main-belt asteroids that fell into the pixel masks of stars have been have been serendipitously observed. Uranus will be observed in a future campaign (C8), as will many more small solar system bodies. Observations of moving bodies as bright as Jupiter and as faint as V=23 have proved successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2 has an ongoing funded Guest Observer program and which has been successfully proposed to by members of the planetary science community. We present K2’s plans and capabilities for solar system science and will have presentations by members of the planetary science community who have used K2 data. This presentation contains information about the mission and its capabilities, discusses the proposal cycles and provides examples, and has community folks talking about their K2 science.&lt;/p&gt;

Given the proposal review timeline, and associated data processing and archive activities, there can be a significant delay between proposal submission and final target selection for each K2 campaign. To provide a faster mechanism for headline astrophysics with K2 we provide an alternative means for acquiring K2 data, through the Director's Discretionary Target (DDT) program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the DDT program for K2 is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respond to targets of opportunity, e.g. newly discovered exoplanets or supernovae&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yield high-impact science from K2 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance existing GO programs with additional data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DDT program for K2 occurs on a rolling basis; observations can be proposed for at any time starting with targets in Campaign 8. However, to ensure that approved targets are included in the final target lists for each campaign, proposals must be submitted by the following dates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 5, 2015 for Campaign 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December 10, 2015 for Campaign 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 10, 2016 for Campaign 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposals require a 2-page scientific justification and a target table and should be &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-ddt.html"&gt;submitted on the DDT page&lt;/a&gt;. The required format as well as a &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-proposing-targets.html#target-table"&gt;template for the target table can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. The fixed locations and observing windows of Campaigns 8, 9, and 10 are provided at &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-fields.html"&gt;the field information page&lt;/a&gt;. Target overlap with the current GO target list will not be considered unless short cadence observations are being requested of a current long cadence target. DDT proposals will be sent to external reviewers; final selection will be at the discretion of the Guest Observer Office Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to observe several hundred targets through the DDT program, which amounts to a few per cent of the total targets allocated. The exact number of DDTs to be observed largely depends on the number of short versus long cadence DDTs approved. There is no proprietary period and no associated funding for approved DDT programs. Proposals from any institution are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We particularly encourage DDT proposals for Campaign 9, which is a non-standard campaign. The Campaign 9 microlensing experiment involves the Kepler spacecraft observing in the positive velocity vector (+VV) direction at fields toward the Galactic bulge.

In Campaign 7 there was a significant drop in the number of targets observed relative to previous campaigns. This drop was because the number of targets we can observe is a function of our on-board compression efficiency. The extremely dense nature of the Campaign 7 field forced us to assume a poorer compression estimate than we used for earlier campaigns. This target list consists of 13,469 standard long cadence and 72 standard short cadence targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tiled a region around the open cluster Ruprecht 147 using 60 individual pixel masks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we included large pixel masks over 3 Trojan/Hilda Asteroids and the (dwarf) planet Pluto. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled just a subset of the pixels that make up the path the Trojans/Hildas move along. These observations are in long cadence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also observed 10 very bright stars by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets but excluding the bleed columns.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Updated K2 Data Release Schedule</title><link href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/updated-k2-data-release-schedule.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-09-10T14:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-09-10:updated-k2-data-release-schedule.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The K2 project have updated the dates we expect to release K2 data to the &lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/"&gt;MAST&lt;/a&gt;.

In Campaign 4, 15,853 long cadence and 122 short cadence targets were observed. Additionally, large circular pixel masks were collected that cover bright 3-5 mag B-stars and red giants in the Hyades and Pleiades open clusters.  Data for these nine stars are listed by custom aperture number at MAST, rather than by EPIC number.  A Trans-Neptunian Object (2002 KY14) was also observed, and 1340 pixel masks were collected to cover the trajectory of this moving target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data release notes for Campaign 4 are available &lt;a href="k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-4"&gt;on this website&lt;/a&gt;. Users are encouraged to read the release notes in full and note in particular the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the dust clouds near the Pleiades, the background removal near the cluster has larger than normal residuals. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/K2drn/C4/C4_reduced_ap_targets.txt"&gt;887 stellar targets&lt;/a&gt; that have light curves with more noise than expected, as they were likely created with non-optimal apertures.  This is due to incompatibility between K2 roll motion and determination of photometric optimal apertures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fraction (23.8%) of stellar targets have light curves generated from apertures that are larger than optimal because they have lower than expected flux compared to their Kepler magnitudes in the EPIC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A different group of stars have higher than expected flux, also resulting in non-optimal apertures.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all results are scientifically significant, there are some that hold the added luster of public appeal. At the basic level, public appeal can be qualified as 'firsts' (the first Earth-sized planet); has a tie to popular culture (Kepler-16b or "Tatooine" and is also a 'first'); or sparks curiosity (catching a supernova before the explosion, or a disintegrating planet). These are the hooks that grab the attention of the public and spurs additional learning. A news hook can be obvious but can require discussion to ferret out the story.&lt;/p&gt;

Campaign 2 &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/GuestInvestigationsC02.shtml"&gt;target list&lt;/a&gt; consists of 13,399 standard long cadence and 54 short cadence targets. In addition we have included large pixel masks over the clusters M4 and M80. If a target falls within either the M4 or M80 large mask it will not appear in the target list. Two Solar System bodies were selected - trans-Neptunian object (278361) 2007 JJ43 and Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring). The Solar System bodies are moving relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. The full cluster and Solar System pixel masks are made up of many smaller masks.

This is a milestone release because it utilizes the first uniform processing of the entire Kepler data set and it represents a first attempt at fully automating the dispositioning process so as to produce a uniformly vetted catalog of planetary candidates (PCs) and false positives (FPs). This is being done via the use of "robovetters" - sophisticated decision trees that utilize a set of targeted metrics to mimic the decision-making process. While all KOIs in the Q1-Q17 DR24 KOI table are given dispositions, work on the robovetters is not yet complete. Thus, before the table is closed more KOIs will be added and dispositions will change.

Courtesy of &lt;a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3853"&gt;Vanderburg and Johnson (2014)&lt;/a&gt;, long-cadence targets from Campaigns 0 and 1 now have detrended, extracted lightcurves available at MAST, including 20 different photometric apertures. There's a MAST Classic Search Interface so you can get lightcurves based on target IDs, coordinates, EPIC catalog fluxes, etc. You can also use our interactive plotter to explore the lightcurves using any of the photometric apertures before downloading the FITS files.

This data was collected between Feb 4-13, 2014, before Campaign 0, and points to a different region of sky to Campaign 0, RA = 359 deg, Dec = -2 deg. In future publications and presentations, we would be grateful if you referred to these data collectively as the "Two-wheel Concept Engineering Test". The motivation for delivering this test data is described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help the community in the endeavor of maximizing photometric quality and precision of a two-wheel mission we have delivered &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/tpf_eng/"&gt;engineering data to the MAST archive&lt;/a&gt;. The Kepler spacecraft operated with fine-guidance, collecting data from 2,017 target masks. The properties and quality of the data therein is expected to be similar to those collected during Campaign 0 and provide an excellent opportunity for scientists to make an early and impactful start upon their investigations. Note also that the chances of there being undiscovered planet transits in this engineering set are high and the potential for other serendipitous science is great. To this end we have also provided lists of &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/tpf_eng/K2_E2_targets_lc.csv"&gt;long cadence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/tpf_eng/K2_E2_targets_sc.csv"&gt;short cadence&lt;/a&gt; targets with a brief description of why each was observed during the test. For those investigators eager to develop this test data scientifically and those investigators with the enthusiasm to develop new technical solutions for two-wheel photometry, we encourage you to dive wholeheartedly into this data set. A typical file size for one of these target pixel files is 26 MB. The Kepler Science Center will not support this engineering data with future reprocessings, deliveries or new products. However the Kepler Science Center will support questions through the helpdesk regarding this data set on a best-effort basis. &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
