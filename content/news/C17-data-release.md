The pipeline-processed data for K2 Campaign 17
are now available for download
from the [K2 data archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).

Campaign 17 provided a substantial overlap with Campaign 6,
offering a longer baseline for stellar activity, asteroseismology, and AGN studies,
as well as enabling dozens of K2 planet candidates to be revisited.

The [target list](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-17) featured
more than 34,000 targets,
including 3,000+ candidate M dwarf stars,
10,000+ candidate FGK main-sequence stars,
and 14,000+ galaxies.
Notable short cadence targets included dozens of planet systems,
67 variable white dwarfs, 47 cool flare stars, and 17 bright solar-type stars.

As a reminder: users are strongly encouraged to contact, cite, and collaborate
with the teams who proposed the observations, as listed on the
[Approved Progams & Targets page](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-17).
