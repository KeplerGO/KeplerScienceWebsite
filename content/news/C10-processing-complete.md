Pipeline processing for K2 Campaign 10 is now complete
and the data are in the process of being shipped
to [the data archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).
We anticipate that the data will become available for download
on or before December 22nd.

Alongside 28,345 standard long cadence and 138 short cadence targets,
the [Campaign 10 science program](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-10)
included a large number of galaxies owing to the field's location
near the north galactic pole.
The extragalactic targets include the well-known quasar 3C 273.

Keep an eye on this website for an announcement of the release
and the associated [data release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html).
