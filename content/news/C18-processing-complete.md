Data processing for K2 Campaign 18 is now complete
and the pixel files and lightcurves are in the process
of being shipped to the [data archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).
We anticipate that the data release will be announced before the end of the month.

Campaign 18 provided Kepler's third visit to the key part of the sky that contains the M44 and M67 star clusters, providing a 3-year baseline for these benchmark clusters. The [target list](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-18) also contained dozens of confirmed and candidate transiting exoplanets, a large number of low-mass flare stars, and the well-known AGN [OJ 287](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OJ_287).

Please keep an eye on our website for an announcement of the release
and the associated [data release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html).

The cartoon below displays a summary of some of the field's most notable targets.
