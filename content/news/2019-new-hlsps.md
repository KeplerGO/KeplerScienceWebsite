Over the past six months, the Kepler/K2 data archive at MAST has added or updated the following five High Level Science Products:

* [KG-RADII](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/kg-radii) (Berger et al) is a new product which provides revised stellar and exoplanet properties from the original Kepler mission based on parallaxes from Gaia DR2.
* [KEPSEISMIC](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/kepseismic) (Mathur et al) is a new product which provides light curves optimized for asteroseismology. The first release contains 28,000 Kepler targets.
* [K2SUPERSTAMP](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2superstamp) (Cody et al) has been updated to include mosaics of the K2 Campaign 9 microlensing area.
* [K2SFF](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sff) (Vanderburg et al) has been updated to include systematics-corrected light curves from K2 Campaign 18.
* [EVEREST](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/everest) (Luger et al) is being updated to include systematics-corrected light curves from K2 Campaigns 14 through 18.

In meanwhile, the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu) has made updates to the K2 candidates list.  There are now more than 1,000 unique K2 candidates ([available here](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=k2candidates)).  The ExoFOP-K2 site continues to be utilized by the community with more than 2700 recorded imaging observations, 1700 recorded spectroscopic observations, and nearly 600,000 uploaded files.  All of these data are publicly available to the community at [https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/k2/](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/k2/).

Teams interested in hosting their High Level Science Products or follow-up data are encouraged to get in touch with the Kepler/K2 archives at MAST and NExSci.
