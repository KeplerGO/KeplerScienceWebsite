Over the past six months, the Kepler/K2 data archive at MAST has added or updated the following five High Level Science Products:

* [KG-RADII](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/kg-radii) (Berger et al.) is a new product which provides revised stellar and exoplanet properties from the original Kepler mission based on parallaxes from Gaia DR2.
* [KEPSEISMIC](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/kepseismic) (Mathur et al.) is a new product which provides light curves optimized for asteroseismology. The first release contains 28,000 Kepler targets.
* [K2SUPERSTAMP](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2superstamp) (Cody et al.) has been updated to include mosaics of the K2 Campaign 9 microlensing area.
* [K2SFF](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sff) (Vanderburg et al.) has been updated to include systematics-corrected light curves from K2 Campaign 18.
* [EVEREST](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/everest) (Luger et al.) has been updated to include systematics-corrected light curves from K2 Campaigns 14 through 18.

Other teams interested in hosting their High Level Science Products are encouraged to get in touch with the Kepler/K2 archives at MAST and NExSci.
