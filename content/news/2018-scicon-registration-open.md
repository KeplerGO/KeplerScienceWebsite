The <a href='scicon-2019/index.html'>Kepler & K2 Science Conference V</a>
will take place March 4-8, 2019, in Glendale, California.
The meeting will be a celebration of Kepler's 10 years in space
and will serve as a showcase of the bountiful results that continue to come
from both the Kepler and K2 missions.

Abstracts for conference presentations can now be submitted through the
[abstract submission form](https://catcopy.ipac.caltech.edu/ksc2019/abstract.php).
Participants may submit multiple abstracts to propose talks, posters, or breakout sessions.
**The regular abstract deadline is November 15, 2018.**

Note that the Wednesday afternoon of the meeting (March 6) is set aside for breakout sessions
to enable the community to discuss and work on Kepler/K2 related projects.
We envision these sessions will be more hands on, unconference sessions
of broad interest to the community.
Examples of break out sessions include panel discussions, hack activities,
work meetings of large collaborations, or tutorials to use data/software products related to Kepler/K2.
To submit a proposal for a breakout session, please select this option on the abstract submission form.

In addition to the abstract submission form,
a [separate registration form](https://catcopy.ipac.caltech.edu/ksc2019/registration.php) has been opened.
There is no registration fee for this conference,
however we ask that all attendees register by February 10, 2019.

Additional details, including information about travel and lodging,
are available on the [conference home page](/scicon-2019/).
