Title: K2 Campaigns 12 and 14 reprocessed

Two years ago [we announced](k2-uniform-global-reprocessing-underway.html) that we were undertaking an effort to reprocess campaigns 0&ndash;14 using the same version of the Kepler/K2 pipeline used for C15 and subsequent campaigns. This version introduced several new features and improvements, such as more sophisticated pixel calibration, better identification of spacecraft pointing, improved cosmic ray correction, and production of short-cadence lightcurves, along with several other minor improvements. Please see the [associated news post](k2-uniform-global-reprocessing-underway.html) for details on each feature.

Reprocessed data and release notes from campaigns 12 and 14 are now available; 0&ndash;8, 11 and 13 were made available previously, and campaign 9 will not be reprocessed (see processing status figures below).  **This marks the end of the uniform global reprocessing effort.**

The newest data are available via the usual [K2 data download interfaces at the MAST archive](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/); the older data has been kept available via the [MAST browser interface](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/) (e.g., [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/target_pixel_files/old_release_bundles/) for tarballs of the old target pixel files (TPFs) and [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/lightcurves/old_release_tarfiles/) for tarballs of the old lightcurve files, if previously produced). The data release notes have been updated for each reprocessed campaign, available at the nominal [K2 Data Release Notes page](k2-data-release-notes.html); links to the old version of the release notes are also provided for posterity.

**As always, users are highly encouraged to read the updated [C12 Data Release Notes](k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-12) and [C14 Data Release Notes](k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-14).**  

Some notable changes with the C12 and C14 reprocessings include:

* Overall improved pixel-level calibration for both campaigns, especially for channels affected by FGS crosstalk.
* Improved spacecraft pointing outlier detection for both campaigns.
* Production of short-cadence lightcurves (234 C12 targets and 147 C10 targets), which previously did not exist.
