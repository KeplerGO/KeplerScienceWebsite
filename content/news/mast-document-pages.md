The Milkulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) has created two pages dedicated to organizing Kepler and K2 mission documents.

Documents are organized into groups, listing the title of each document that links to the PDF, a brief description of its content/purpose, and citation information.

Users are likely to find these pages useful when searching for documentation on Kepler and K2 flight operations, target selection, observing history, hardware, software, data products, data characteristics, etc.
