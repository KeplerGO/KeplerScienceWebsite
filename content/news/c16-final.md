We [previously announced](change-to-campaign-16-field-position-and-delay-to-go-cycle-5-deadline.html) that in order to maximize the science return from the remaining fuel, K2 Campaign 16 will now be a forward-facing campaign. This is to facilitate science that benefits from simultaneous observations from Earth.

The [position of this field](k2-fields.html) has been finalized. The position was chosen to maximize the number of known low-redshift galaxies, while also enabling the collection of a significant fractions of both M67 and the Beehive cluster (aka Praesepe, M44). The campaign will begin around December 7, 2017 and last approximately 80 days. Campaign 16 has a 30% overlap with the Campaign 5 field.

To determine whether targets fall on-silicon, all investigators must update their version of the
<a href="software.html#k2fov">K2fov target selection tool</a>
 and ensure they are using v6.0 or higher. 

The new C16 EPIC catalog will be available at MAST within the next couple of weeks. The deadline for Step-1 proposals is November 3 at 23:59 EST. Information about the proposal process, including the scope, evaluation criteria, availability of funds, eligibility, target selection tools, submission process, and frequently asked questions, is detailed on the proposal preparation page.
