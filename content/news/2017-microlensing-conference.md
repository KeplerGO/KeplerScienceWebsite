The 21st International Microlensing Conference—entitled "Ushering in the New Age of Microlensing from Space"—will take place on February 1–3, 2017, in Pasadena, California.

The conference intends to highlight results from [K2's Campaign 9](/k2-c9.html), a combined ground- and space-based microlensing survey that was carried out using the Kepler spacecraft this summer.
The conference will also feature results from other space- and ground-based 
microlensing surveys, and will be preceded by a free half-day workshop featuring a series of introductory microlensing talks.
