Title: DDT deadline for K2 Campaign 18 approaching 
Date: 2017-12-28 02:00
Author: Geert Barentsen

A small percentage of the available pixels in each K2 campaign may be
allocated as [Director's Discretionary Targets (DDTs)](k2-ddt.html).
The primary goal of the DDT program is to enable
exceptional, time-critical observing opportunities.

We are currently accepting DDT proposals for Campaigns 18 and 19.
**Owing to the overlaps with previous fields,
C18 offers the opportunity to revisit targets from C5, 
while C19 enables re-observations of objects from C3 and C12.**
DDT proposals based on recent analyses of these previous fields
are particularly encouraged, e.g. newly-discovered planet candidates.

DDT proposals are due by 23:59 PT (Pacific Time) on the following dates: 

* Campaign 18: Jan 19, 2018
* Campaign 19: Apr 12, 2018

For further information on the DDT program and the requirements
for proposal submission,
[consult the DDT web page](k2-ddt.html).
Proposals should be submitted via email to [keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov](mailto:keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov).
