The [Kepler/K2 workshop on Dwarf Stars and Clusters](cluster-workshop) was held on
January 16-18, 2018, at Boston University.
The event was attended by over 50 participants and featured talks, stimulating discussions,
and new collaborations. 
A highlight of the workshop was the *unconference* held on the final day,
during which participants worked on software, analyzed data, and planned future observations.

Several tutorials were presented, and you can now follow along by viewing and/or downloading
them online:

* PyKE tutorial by Christina Hedges: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJMPUKiiDJ0
