Long cadence light curves, target pixel files, and full frame images 
for K2 Campaign 8 are now available for download 
from the [K2 data archive at MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/).
The data are not yet searchable using the [K2 data search interface](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/data_search/search.php),
which will be available later this week.

The Campaign 8 target list included 24187 standard long cadence
and 54 short cadence targets.

In addition, the campaign included several custom masks:

* The planet ***Uranus*** was observed for roughly a month in short cadence,
and the remaining time in long cadence.
* Four irregular ***Uranian satellites*** were observed in long cadence over a period of one month (Caliban, Sycorax, Prospero, Setebos).
* Six ***Hilda asteroids*** were observed in long cadence (1999 TJ90, 1999TS40, 1999 VG135, 2000 WC140, 2006 UB219, 2007 RY194).
* Four ***Trans-Neptunian Objects*** (TNOs) were observed in long cadence (1998 SN165, 2001 QT322, 2003 QW90, 2005 RS43).
* The irregular dwarf galaxy ***IC 1613*** was covered using a 120-by-160 pixel mask.
* Finally, we covered several very bright stars using custom pixel masks that
collect the wings of the PSF.
