The Milkulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) has made data from the Kepler mission available on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The available data products include light curve files, target pixel files, and full frame images for all 17 quarters of Kepler observations.  Access to this resource is also available through the astroquery Python library, after enabling cloud data.

More details and instructions on how to access the data on AWS can be found in [this announcement from MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/contents/newsletters/november-2019/kepler-mission-data-available-through-aws) and in the [MAST Labs blog post](https://mast-labs.stsci.io/2019/10/kepler-data-available-on-aws).
