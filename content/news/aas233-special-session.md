Author: Geert Barentsen

The [233rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS)](https://aas.org/meetings/aas233), which is being held in Seattle in January, will feature two Special Sessions dedicated to Kepler and K2.

The first session, titled <b>"Kepler and K2's 500,000 high-precision lightcurves: prospects for future discoveries"</b> will look forward to the future discoveries expected from Kepler's large and unprecedented data set, discuss new and emerging uses of the data, and discuss new software tools and novel analysis methods. The session will be held on <b>Thursday, January 10th at 2pm</b>, and will consist of invited talks, a panel discussion,
and contributed posters.

The second session, titled <b>"First Results from the Kepler/K2 Supernova Experiment"</b>, will feature new results from the diverse set of extragalactic transients which have recently been observed by Kepler.
This session will take place on <b>Tuesday, January 8th at 10am</b>.

Abstract submission is now open for contributed posters, 
and we encourage everyone to submit an abstract to present
the potential of future discoveries using Kepler and K2 data.
Abstracts are due 3 October 2018 via the [standard AAS abstract submission system](http://aas.org/meetings/aas233/abstracts) (select the option "Special Sessions Accepting Posters" in Step 3 of your submission).
Researchers who prefer to present a talk are encouraged
to select the "Contributed Oral session" option instead.

The talk schedules are listed below.
