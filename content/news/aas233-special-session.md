The Kepler/K2 Mission is convening a special session at the
[233rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society (AAS)](https://aas.org/meetings/aas233), which is being held in Seattle in January.

The session is titled <b>"Kepler and K2's 500,000 high-precision lightcurves: prospects for future discoveries"</b> and will look forward to the future discoveries expected from Kepler's large and unprecedented data set, discuss new and emerging uses of the data, and discuss new software tools and novel analysis methods.

The session will be held on <b>Thursday, January 10th at 2:00pm</b>,
and will consist of invited talks, a panel discussion,
and contributed posters.

Abstract submission is now open for contributed posters, 
and we encourage everyone to submit an abstract to present
the potential of future discoveries using Kepler and K2 data.
Abstracts are due 3 October 2018 via the [standard AAS abstract submission system](http://aas.org/meetings/aas233/abstracts) (select the option "Special Sessions Accepting Posters" in Step 3 of your submission).
Researchers who prefer to present a talk at the conference are encouraged
to select the "Contributed Oral session" option instead in this step.

 - 2:30pm — “What will Kepler/K2 teach us about our Galaxy?” — <i>James Davenport, University of Washington</i>
 - 2:40pm — “What will Kepler/K2 teach us about other galaxies?” — <i>Krista Lynne Smith, Stanford University</i>
 - 2:50pm — “How can new data analysis methods get more out of Kepler/K2 data” — <i>Dan Foreman-Mackey, Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics</i>
 - 3:00pm — “How can machine learning contribute to mining Kepler / K2 data?” — <i>Megan Ansdell, UC Berkeley</i>
