Data processing for K2 Campaign 12 is now complete
and the pixel files and lightcurves are being shipped
to the [data archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).
We anticipate that the data will become available in the week of July 24th.

The target list included 29,221 standard long cadence
and 141 standard short cadence targets,
alongside TRAPPIST-1, Chiron,
and a large number of asteroids and galaxies.

Keep an eye on our website for an announcement of the release
and the associated [data release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html).
