**FIRST ANNOUNCEMENT: "Kepler & K2 Science Conference IV: Legacy &
Scion"** </br>
June 19-23, 2017 </br>
NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA </br>

Over the past 8 years, high-precision photometry from the Kepler/K2 mission has enabled breakthrough discoveries in exoplanet science, asteroseismology, eclipsing binary stars, solar-system objects, and extragalactic science. To celebrate the legacy and latest science results of Kepler/K2 we invite the community to the 4th Kepler & K2 Science Conference, hosted at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, CA. We welcome contributions from any area of science related to the Kepler/K2 mission, as well as related future missions such as TESS. We are looking forward to celebrating the Kepler/K2 science and legacy with the community!

Note that Wednesday afternoon (June 21) has been reserved for breakout sessions to enable the community to discuss and work on Kepler/K2 related projects. We envision that these sessions will be more hands-on ("unconference" sessions) compared to traditional talks, ideally with broad interest to the community. Examples for breakout sessions could include panel discussions, hack activities, work meetings of larger collaborations, or tutorials to use data/software products related to Kepler/K2. To submit a proposal for a breakout session please select the appropriate abstract preference during registration.
