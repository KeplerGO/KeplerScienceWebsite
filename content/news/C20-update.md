Following a successful return of data from K2 Campaign 19,
the Kepler team commanded the spacecraft into position to begin collecting data for Campaign 20.

On Friday October 19, during a regularly scheduled spacecraft contact using NASAâ€™s Deep Space Network, the team learned that the spacecraft had paused Campaign 20 and transitioned to its no-fuel-use sleep mode.

The Kepler team is currently assessing the cause and evaluating possible next steps.
