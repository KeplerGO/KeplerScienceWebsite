The due date for Step-1 proposals is 23:59 EST September 23, 2016.
Step-2 proposals are due by 23:59 EST November 4, 2016.
Investigators may not submit a Step-2 proposal without first submitting a Step-1 proposal by the due date.

Information about the proposal process, including the scope,
evaluation criteria, availability of funds, eligibility,
target selection tools, submission process, and frequently asked questions, is detailed on the [proposal preparation page](/k2-proposing-targets.html).


### K2fov update required

The final field positions for Campaigns 14, 15, and 16 have recently
been set based on community input.
All investigators *must* update their version of the
<a href="software.html#k2fov">K2fov target selection tool</a>
to version 5.0, released on 1 Aug 2016,
to take the final field positions into account. 

K2fov can be updated from the command line using pip:

    pip install K2fov --upgrade

The version number of your K2fov installation may be verified
using the following command:

    python -c "import K2fov; print(K2fov.__version__)"

This should return "5.0.0" or higher. If the number is lower,
or if you see an error message, then your installation of K2fov is outdated.
