With the astronomy job season in full swing,
we alert our community to several post-doctoral job opportunities
which emphasize the use of Kepler and K2 data:

* [postdoc position at Aarhus University](http://phys.au.dk/en/news/vacancies/) (closes Dec 1);
* [postdoc position at the University of California, Riverside](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/22e19437) (closes Dec 15);
* [postdoc position at Caltech/IPAC/NExScI](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/c15f9a29) (closes Dec 20);

* [postdoc position at NASA Ames](https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/details/?ro=19108) (closing date unspecified).

We also note that multiple Kepler/K2 users have been successful
in securing fellowships in recent years.
For example, applications for the [NASA Hubble Fellowship Program](https://nhfp.stsci.edu/) (which replaces the previous Einstein, Hubble, and Sagan Fellowship Programs) are due by Nov 2nd, 2017.

If you have a Kepler/K2-relatd job opening that you would like us to advertise, then please contact us at keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov.
