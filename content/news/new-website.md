The Kepler/K2 Science Center has launched a new website.
The reorganized pages, which you are looking at right now,
provide resources for scientists interested in using data from the missions.

New features of the website include:

* an updated list of <a href="k2-fields.html">future K2 campaign fields</a>;
* instructions to apply for <a href="k2-ddt.html">Director's Discretionary Time (DDT)</a> during Campaigns 9 and 10;
* preliminary instructions to <a href="k2-proposing-targets.html#campaigns-11-12-13">apply for targets and funding</a> related to Campaigns 11, 12 and 13</a>;
* information on the <a href="k2-c9.html">Campaign 9 microlensing experiment</a>;
* a comprehensive overview of the <a href="data-products.html">Kepler and K2 data products</a>;
* a new <a href="publications.html">publication database</a> including <a href="publications.html#most-cited-publications">citation statistics</a>.

The previous Science Center website <a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/index_old.shtml">has been preserved</a> with a warning message at the top of the old pages.
