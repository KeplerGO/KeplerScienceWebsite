The [K2 Campaign 10 science program](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-10) 
has been posted online.
The target list includes 28,345 standard long cadence
and 138 short cadence targets. 

Owing to the high galactic latitude of the field,
the standard long cadence targets include 4,950 small galaxies.
In addition, 27 larger galaxies are targeted using custom pixel masks.
The short cadence list includes the well-known extragalactic object [3C 273](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3C_273), which is the optically brightest quasar in the sky. 

In addition, large pixel masks will be obtained to cover 11 Trojan/Hilda asteroids, 4 TNOs, 
and comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko which is currently being investigated by the Rosetta mission.
Finally, K2 will also observe 8 very bright stars by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets but excluding the bleed columns.
