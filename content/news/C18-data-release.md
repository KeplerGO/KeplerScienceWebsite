The pipeline-processed data for K2 Campaign 18
are now available for download
from the [K2 data archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).

Campaign 18 saw Kepler's third visit to the ***K2 Legacy Field*** in the constellation of Cancer,
which contains the benchmark star clusters M44 and M67.
This field has now been observed during three Campaigns (5, 16, 18) across a 3-year baseline and 8-month duty cycle.

The target list contained
20,929 standard long cadence
and 234 standard short cadence targets,
including:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Two open star clusters</b>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>M44</b> is one of the most nearby open star clusters
            and is known to contain at least six confirmed planets
            (K2-95b, K2-100b, K2-101b, K2-102b, K2-103b, K2-104b).
            Its members were observed using standard masks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>M67</b> is the benchmark star cluster
            with solar-like age and metallicity.
            Hundreds of stars in the cluster core were observed
            using 121 unique 40x40-pixel long cadence aperture masks
            which created a contiguous 440x440 pixel region.
            In addition, hundreds of members in the outskirts
            were observed using standard masks,
            and more than 40 targets were observed
            using short cadence masks.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>
        <b>42 confirmed exoplanets from Campaign 5</b>:
        K2-34b, 95b, 97b, 98b, 100b, 101b, 102b, 103b, 104b, 105b, 108b,
        114b, 115b, 117bc, 118b, 119b, 120b, 121b, 122b, 123b, 124b, 146b,
        180b, 181b, 182b, 183bcd, 184b, 185b, 187bcde, 188bc,
        and HIP 41378 bcdef.
        Most noteworthy, the HIP 41378 system is a bright F-type dwarf (V=9)
        shown by Campaign 5 to host at least five planets.
        The majority of these confirmed planet systems are being observed
        in short cadence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Dozens of unconfirmed planet candidates</b> from Campaign 5
        were re-observed, the majority in long cadence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>60 low-mass flare stars</b> and <b>59 variable white dwarfs</b>
        were observed in short cadence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>13 very bright stars</b> were observed
        using custom circular masks, including
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_Cancri">ζ Cancri</a>
        and 25 Cancri in short cadence,
        and  η, γ, X, 21, 29, 49, 50, and 60 Cancri in long cadence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>OJ 287</b> is a well-studied bright galaxy (V=15) which is
        thought to show lightcurve variations due to a <b>binary supermassive black hole</b> at its center.  It was observed in short cadence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>37 Solar System objects</b> including
        22 comets and trojan Asteroids,
        9 faint Trans-Neptunian Objects, and the
        <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis">
        potentially hazardous asteroid 99942 Apophis</a></b>
        were observed in long cadence.
