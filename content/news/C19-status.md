The Kepler spacecraft began collecting science data on Aug. 29 for its 19th observation campaign.
However, after being roused from sleep mode the spacecraft’s configuration has been modified due to unusual behavior exhibited by one of the thrusters.
Preliminary indications are that the telescope’s pointing performance may be somewhat degraded.
It remains unclear how much fuel remains;
NASA continues to monitor the health and performance of the spacecraft.

Several science programs seek to complement Campaign 19 data using simultaneous observations carried out using other telescope facilities.
The PI's of these programs can phone the Kepler GO office at +1-650-604-2784
to request guidance as needed.
