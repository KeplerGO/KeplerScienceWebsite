We are attempting a global, uniform reprocessing. Best-effort basis.


<br>

**The plan**

Starting with C15, all new campaigns are processed uniformly.

New campaigns given top priority.

Priority of older campaigns: C2, C13, C0, C11, C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7. C8. C9, C10, C12, C14

All data will be at [K2 data archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2) and new data will replace old as default. Old data will be retained in sub-directory.


**Changes**

**Significant**

These are listed because they affect all of the data at a significant level.

* Dynablack
* Pointing Flags
* Short-Cadence
* Cosmic-Ray Threshold


*Minor*

These are listed because they affect only portions of the K2 data or at a minor level.

* C13 Aldeberan
* Scrambled uncertatinties
* Momentum dump flag
* LDE parity error


Probably add red and blue box figures
