A few months ago we announced that we were undertaking an effort to reprocess campaigns 0&ndash;14 using the same version of the pipeline used for campaign 15 and subsequent campaigns. This version introduced several new features, such as more sophisticated pixel calibration, better identification of spacecraft pointing, improved cosmic ray correction, and production of short-cadence lightcurves, as well as several other minor improvements. Please see the <a href="k2-uniform-global-reprocessing-underway.html"> associated news post</a> for details on each feature.

Reprocessed data and release notes from campaigns 2, 3, and 13 are now available. The newest data are available via the regular [K2 data download interfaces and locations at the MAST archive](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/), while the older data has been kept available via the [MAST browser interface](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/) (e.g., [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/target_pixel_files/old_release_bundles/) for tarballs of the old TPF files and [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/lightcurves/old_release_tarfiles/) for tarballs of the old lightcurves files, if previously produced). The data release notes have been updated for each reprocessed campaign, available at the nominal [K2 Data Release Notes page](k2-data-release-notes.html); links to the old version of the release notes are also provided for posterity.



Below we highlight just some of the improvements that are likely to be of interest to users.
