Data processing for K2 Campaign 17 is now complete
and the pixel files and lightcurves are in the process
of being shipped to the [data archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).
We anticipate that the data release will be announced by next week.

Campaign 17 provided a substantial overlap with Campaign 6,
offering a longer baseline for stellar activity, asteroseismology, and AGN studies,
as well as enabling dozens of K2 planet candidates to be revisited.

The [target list](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-17) featured
more than 34,000 targets,
including 3,000+ candidate M dwarf stars,
10,000+ candidate FGK main-sequence stars,
and 14,000+ galaxies.
Notable short cadence targets included dozens of planet systems,
67 variable white dwarfs, 47 cool flare stars, and 17 bright solar-type stars.

Please keep an eye on our website for an announcement of the release
and the associated [data release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html).
