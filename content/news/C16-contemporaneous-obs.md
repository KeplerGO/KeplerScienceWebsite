K2 Campaign 16 will be "forward-facing", making possible contemporaneous ground-based observations from Earth.  Many of these ground-based observations will provide polychromatic photometry in support of the [K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment](/supernova-experiment.html).  Some of these ancillary data will be made publicly available, and can be repurposed for other K2 targets.  To aid in resource sharing, the K2 Guest Observer Office is crowdsourcing a Google Doc of planned observations targeting the C16 field.
