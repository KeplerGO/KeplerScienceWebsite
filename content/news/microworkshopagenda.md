A [draft agenda](/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/Agenda/) is now available for the [K2 Microlensing Workshop](/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/). This will likely be updated as we get closer to the workshop.

The [venue for the workshop](/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/Venue/) will be the SETI Institute in Mountain View, CA. Note that this is a change to the originally advertised venue.

There will be talks from Steve Howell (K2 Project Scientist, NASA Ames), Tom Barclay (K2 Guest Observer Office Director, NASA Ames), Doug Hudgins (NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program Scientist and K2 Deputy Program Scientist, NASA HQ) and Fergal Mullally (K2 Science Officer, NASA Ames), in addition to contributed talks from members of the scientific community.
