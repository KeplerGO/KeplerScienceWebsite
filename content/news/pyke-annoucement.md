We are pleased to announce that a new beta version of PyKE, the data analysis
package of the Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Office, has been released and it is
ready to be installed via ``pip``::

    $ pip install pyketools

PyKE version 3 beta 0 provides the following key improvements::

    * PyKE is now a true Python package installable via `pip`;
    * tasks are now added to the path as unix-style command-line tools;
    * both Python 2 and 3 are now supported;
    * PyKE no longer depends on PyRAF and is TESS-ready.

The development of PyKE takes place on [Github](https://github.com/KeplerGO/PyKE),
and its documentation lives in [readthedocs](https://pyke.readthedocs.io).
