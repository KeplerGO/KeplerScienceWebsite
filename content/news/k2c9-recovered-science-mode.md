The Kepler spacecraft has officially been recovered since it was
first discovered to be in Emergency Mode on April 7.  Science operations
are now resuming as planned, with K2 Campaign 9 beginning
today, April 22.  Campaign 9 involves the spacecraft looking toward
the Galactic Center to primarily search for gravitational microlensing
events.  In addition to microlensing targets, a number of Director's
Discretionary Targets (DDTs) were approved.  The full target
list for Campaign 9 can be found <a href="/k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-9">here</a>.
