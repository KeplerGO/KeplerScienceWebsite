The pipeline-processed data for K2 Campaign 19 are now available for download from the [K2 data archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2). The C19 [data release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-19) are also available, and ***users are strongly encouraged to [read the release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-19), particularly due to the complicated pointing history and resulting data quality of C19***.

Campaign 19 is K2's final campaign. Observations for C19 were collected for about a month, at which point the Kepler team received data showing that the spacecraft no longer had sufficient remaining fuel to point precisely enough to gather useful scientific data, and [observations were again paused](k2-campaign-19-ended-to-downlink-data.html) and then later [successfully downloaded](k2-campaign-19-raw-data-available.html). While [an attempt was made to start Campaign 20](kepler-spacecraft-update.html), without sufficient fuel [end-of-flight was declared and the spacecraft was retired](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-retires-kepler-space-telescope-passes-planet-hunting-torch).

Campaign 19 partially overlaps with Campaigns 3 and 12, as well as the engineering test field, while also surveying ~15 deg<sup>2</sup> of previously unstudied sky. The Campaign 19 target list includes <b>33,863 standard long cadence</b> and <b>216 standard short cadence</b> targets located towards the constellation of Aquarius.
The target list includes the nearby planet systems <b>TRAPPIST-1</b> and <b>GJ 9827</b>. These systems host some of the most amenable small planets for atmospheric characterization known to date, i.e., TRAPPIST-1 f, GJ 9827 b, and GJ 9827 d.

Other notable targets include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Dozens of confirmed and candidate exoplanets</b> previously discovered
        during K2 Campaigns 3 and 12, including K2-138, the resonant system of
        five planets <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/multi-planet-system-found-through-crowdsourcing">discovered by citizen scientists</a>,
        and HD 215152, a system <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A&A...614A.133D">known to contain four short-period RV planets</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        A large sample of <b>low-mass flare stars</b> and <b>white dwarfs</b>
        in short cadence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>11,501 galaxies</b> are being surveyed for supernovae and other transients.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>30 Solar System objects</b> are being monitored, including <b>planet Neptune</b> and its moon Triton in short cadence, and comet 2P/Encke in long cadence.
      </li>
    </ul>
