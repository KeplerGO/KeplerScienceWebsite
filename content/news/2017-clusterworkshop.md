The K2 Mission and Boston University are happy to announce that a small workshop on Dwarfs Stars and Clusters with K2
will take place from January 16 to 18, 2018 on the BU campus in Boston Massachusetts. This event will highlight the
science that K2 has enabled in the areas of cool stars and open clusters. Topics will include stellar rotation and activity,
eclipsing binaries, young stellar objects, and planets in clusters. 

The [conference website](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/cluster-workshop) is now live, and you may [register your interest](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZCWOJd_L10gG-IQ9QYLkKDkkDM99Hn3awA3KStSz2B0AzCQ/viewform?c=0&w=1) in attending this workshop.
