The Kepler spacecraft has successfully downloaded Campaign 18 data to Earth.
The raw data are now available for download
from the [K2 data archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).

We are monitoring the spacecraft very closely and will provide more information
when its status has been fully assessed.
Scientists who are carrying out simultaneous observations from the ground
using other telescope facilities may phone the Kepler GO office at +1-650-604-2784
to request guidance as needed.
