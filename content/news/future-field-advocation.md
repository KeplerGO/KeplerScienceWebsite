Title: Request for Community Input on Campaigns 17 and 18 Field Positions
Date: 2017-03-24 09:00
Author: Knicole Colon

The fields for K2 Campaigns 17 and beyond have not yet been
finalized. We strive to optimize these future fields based on
potential science.  We are soliciting feedback now from the community about the
placement of these fields.

**[We ask that all requests for specific field placements be received by
April XX and be submitted here]()**.  When submitting a request, keep
in mind that we can only shift the field along the ecliptic, not up or
down. We anticipate finalizing the field positions in early May,
at which point the final fields will be announced.

## Campaign 17

This campaign is designated as having a forward-facing field, in
part to continue with the Campaign 16 Supernova Experiment and enable
simultaneous observations from the Earth and Kepler spacecraft.

Possible field options are outlined in the table below.  All options
have a start date of 3 March 2018 (5 days after the end of Campaign
16). Note that the C17 field options that overlap with C10 would be
short in duration because they overlap in time with C16.  We would be
required to cut short C16 by a month to enable the C17-C10 overlap to run for >70 days.

## Campaign 18

The field for Campaign 18 largely depends on the location of the Campaign
17 field as well as whether or not Campaign 18 will be posited as a
forward-facing or backward-facing field. If we allow Campaign 18 to begin 5 days after the end of
each of the three options for Campaign 17 noted above, then we have
the following options listed below, for cases of both a forward-facing
and backward-facing field.

* C9 was the microlensing experiment where pixels were primarily collected
  around the Galactic bulge. Therefore, the distribution of targets
  across modules was not uniform in that campaign.
