The ASAS-SN survey [reports the discovery](http://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=11253)
of a bright supernova (V=15) in a nearby galaxy
that is currently being monitored by Kepler
as part of its ongoing K2 Campaign 16.
The event is named ASASSN-18bt (AT 2018oh) and is located
at 09:06:39.6 +19:20:17.5 in the galaxy UGC 4780.

The [initial spectroscopic follow-up](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/k2sn/PZPtW6myNjs/btW_E3BIAwAJ) indicates that the event
is a Type Ia supernova which is still rising
and is several days away from reaching its maximum brightness.
We encourage the community to continue to coordinate the follow-up
of this unique event via the [K2 Supernova Experiment Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/k2sn/PZPtW6myNjs).

**This event is expected to yield the highest-precision, uninterruped lightcurve ever obtained for a supernova.**
Kepler is providing a continuous 30-minute cadence view of the event
from December 7th through February 25th,
i.e. starting 2 months before and ending 3 weeks after the explosion.
