Title: K2 Campaign 16 preliminary target list available

A limitation that K2 users have faced in previous Campaigns is that
simultaneous observations from the ground
were only possible during challenging twilight conditions,
owing to K2's strategy to observe in the backward-facing
direction along its velocity vector.
The backward-facing direction was favored to prevent Earth
from entering the field and scattering light across the focal plane.

**This will change in Campaign 16 (Dec 2017 - Feb 2018), 
when K2 will observe in the forward-facing direction
to enable observations in a field 
that can easily be accessed from Earth at the same time.
This will enable K2's single-bandpass photometry to be
complemented with simultaneous multi-band or
spectroscopic observations from the ground.**

To help the community secure observing resources for this opportunity
ahead of the upcoming proposal deadlines,
the project has prepared a preliminary list of 16,000 targets which
are very likely to be observed during the Campaign.
The list is available as a CSV file ([k2c16-preliminary-target-list.csv](data/campaigns/c16/k2c16-preliminary-target-list.csv))
and contains five columns:

* EPIC ID (empty if not in EPIC);
* RA (decimal degrees);
* Dec (decimal degrees);
* Kp (magnitude);
* Programs (pipe-delimited list of program IDs).

The list does not include custom masks,
such as M67 (the core of which is likely to be observed
using a ~0.5°-by-0.5° super-mask)
and Solar System bodies.

The final list of ~25,000 targets will be available near Oct 2017
and is expected to include all targets from the preliminary list,
except for a small number of (bright) targets which the pipeline may determine
to fall or bleed off silicon.

As a reminder: Campaign 16 is scheduled to run from December 7th, 2017,
through February 25th, 2018.
The field is located at a moderate Galactic Latitude (+35°)
towards the constellation of Cancer (RA 9h, Dec +19°).
The line of sight shows very low foreground extinction (Av ~0.2 mag)
which makes it well-suited for extragalactic
and [supernova science](supernova-experiment/).
The field also contains the well-known clusters M44 (Beehive) and M67.
