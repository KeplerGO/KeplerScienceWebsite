The Kepler/K2 team has recently had two new members join us
at the Ames Research Center in California: Ken Mighell and Nick Saunders.

Dr Ken Mighell joined us from the National Optical Astronomy Observatory.
His background is in the analysis of CCD photometry for the
study of stellar populations and Local Group galaxies.
Ken will be helping the K2 team assess and assure the quality
of the [K2 Uniform Global Processing effort](k2-uniform-global-reprocessing-underway.html)
which is currently underway.

Nick Saunders joined us from the University of Washington
where he recently obtained his Bachelor degrees in both Physics and Literature.
During his studies, Nick worked with Prof Rory Barnes and Dr Rodrigo Luger on the
removal of instrumental noise from Kepler/K2 photometry
for the study of exoplanets.
Nick will be continuing this work during his pre-doctoral gap year
in support of the [Lightkurve data analysis package](https://lightkurve.keplerscience.org).
