The pipeline-processed data for
[K2 Campaign 12](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-12)
are now available for download
from the [K2 archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2). 

The Campaign 12 target list included <b>29,221 standard long cadence</b>
and <b>141 standard short cadence</b> targets,
located in a high-Galactic latitude field (-60&deg;)
towards the constellations of Aquarius and Pisces.
Notable targets in this Campaign included planet hosts <b>TRAPPIST-1</b> (mask ID 200164267), <b>WASP-28</b> (246375295), and <b>HD 218566</b> (246340370),
alongside <b>minor planet Chiron</b> (IDs 200164175–200164266 for long cadence, plus IDs 200161173–200162430 for a 20-day short cadence segment).

We strongly encourage users to read the [C12 data release notes](/k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-12) carefully.
In particular, users should be aware that planet Mars passed through the focal plane during the Campaign, introducing significant saturation, scattered light, and video crosstalk in multiple channels over a period of three weeks.
