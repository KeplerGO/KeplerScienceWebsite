The K2 Guest Observer Office is excited to announce updates to a 
[High Level Science Product (HLSP)](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/hlsps.html)
available at the MAST archive.
The HLSP – called **[K2Superstamp](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2superstamp/)** – consists of a series of FITS images for 
open star clusters and other regions observed by K2 using so-called "superstamp" pixel masks. We previously made available data on
the four clusters M35, M67, Ruprecht 147, and NGC 6530 (the Lagoon Nebula region). We are now releasing five new sets of images, 
all obtained during the Campaign 9 observations of the galactic bulge. 

While the data for all of these regions have long been served on MAST, until recently they were only available as a disconnected set 
of smaller Target Pixel Files (TPFs) because the spacecraft stored these observations in small chunks. With [this new 
release](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2superstamp/), we have stitched these TPFs together into spatially contiguous FITS images 
(one per cadence) to make their scientific analysis easier. In addition, each image has been fit with an accurate WCS solution so 
that you may locate any object of interest via its right ascension and declination.

The process of stitching and astrometric calibration is described in a
[companion RNAAS article](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/aaac30/meta).

The release of these superstamp FITS images makes the analysis of crowded galactic bulge regions simpler, and we hope it will lead to 
new discoveries. We note that the format of the images (data structure and headers) mirrors that of Kepler/K2 and TESS mission full 
frame images. This was not the case for our original K2Superstamp cluster products, and so future versions will update them as well 
as add new sets of data for the cluster M67, which was re-observed in K2 Campaigns 16 and 18. We also plan to release superstamp
images for the two clusters NGC 6819 and 6791 that were observed in the Kepler prime mission.
