Detailed information on the solicitation is available in the
[K2 GO Cycle 7 research announcement (ROSES-2018)](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=610960/solicitationId=%7B8A2B07C0-F3D9-677F-0C28-F0E8406FC3CD%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/D.7%20K2%20Cycle%207%20Amend%2019.pdf).

We warn that Campaign 20 is at risk of not being executed due to Kepler's low fuel status.

Campaign 20 will revisit the **Taurus-Auriga star-forming region** in the
forward-facing mode.
The region contains a large number of very young stars (<10 Myr)
and the Campaign will significantly increase the number of such stars observed by Kepler.
The field also includes members of the Pleiades (&sim;100 Myr) and Hyades (&sim;600 Myr) star clusters,
alongside other populations of stars and galaxies.
