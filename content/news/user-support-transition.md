User support and news updates have transitioned to the NASA Astrophysics archives that host Kepler and K2 data &mdash; the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) and the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI).  Below are ways to get updates from each archive, where to find useful information, and how to contact them to receive help with Kepler and K2 data.  All user support has been transitioned to the archives.

The Kepler/K2 team has been working closely with the NASA Astrophysics archives’ staff over the lifetime of the mission.  The archives’ staff are intimately familiar with the mission’s data and will continue to be an invaluable resource to the community.
