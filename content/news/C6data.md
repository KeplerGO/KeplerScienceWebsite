Long cadence target pixel files and light curves for K2 Campaign 6
are now available for download 
from the [K2 data archive at MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/).

The short cadence data will follow in approximately two weeks,
to allow the [pixel calibration issue that we described last week](problem-with-kepler-and-k2-short-cadence-pixel-calibration.html) to be resolved.

The [Campaign 6 target list](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-6)
contained 28,289 long cadence and 84 short cadence targets.
We also included large pixel masks to cover the trajectories
of 65 Trojan Asteroids.

We strongly encourage users to read the
[Campaign 6 data release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-6).
