A [recent amendment](http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2016/2016/3/11/amendment-1ddap-now-includes-keplerk2-solar-system-observations/)
to NASA's [Discovery Data Analysis Program (DDAP)](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId=%7BE2458B76-679E-DD13-4075-005651FF0CEE%7D&path=open)
permits the submission of proposals for work on Kepler/K2 observations
of solar system targets.
The objective of the DDAP program is to enhance the scientific return
of Discovery Program missions by broadening the scientific participation
in the analysis of data, both recent and archived.

The program intends to fund solar system science.
Proposals using Kepler/K2 observations of objects outside the solar system are not eligible and should be submitted to the Astrophysics Data Analysis Program (ADAP) instead. A non-exhaustive list of K2's solar system targets is given below.

## Background

Because operating in the ecliptic plane minimizes the torque exerted on the spacecraft by solar pressure, the K2 mission entails a series of sequential [observing Campaigns](k2-fields.html) of fields distributed around the ecliptic.
A result of this observing strategy is that the K2 fields
contain a large number of solar system targets,
which can be observed to provide high-cadence, uninterrupted light curves
to e.g. measure rotation periods, constrain object shapes and spin states,
and search for activity in comets or oscillations in giant planets.
Because Solar System objects move relative to the celestial sphere,
long streaks of pixels are downloaded from the Kepler spacecraft to cover
their trajectory (or part thereof).


## Solar system targets in Campaigns 0-10

The K2 mission has so far targeted 108 solar system objects during
Campaigns 0 through 10 as part of the
[approved observing programs](k2-approved-programs.html).
These objects are listed below.

This list is not exhaustive because thousands of objects are known
to have serendipitously been observed for short periods of time
as they passed through the pixel masks of other targets.
A list of these serendipitously-observed targets is not available at this time,
but note that the visibility of solar system targets in past or future K2 Campaigns
can be checked using the [K2ephem command-line tool](https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2ephem).
