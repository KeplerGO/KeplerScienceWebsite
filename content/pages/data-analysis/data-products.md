Title: Kepler and K2 data products
Save_as: data-products.html

[TOC]

There are two archives for *official* Kepler and K2 data products -
the [Exoplanet Archive](http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/)
which is hosted at the
[NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI)](http://nexsci.caltech.edu/)
and the
[Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/)
which is hosted at the
[Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)](http://www.stsci.edu/). The
Exoplanet Archive primarily hosts data related to the Kepler and K2 mission planet searches while the MAST is responsible for hosting time series data and spacecraft calibration products for Kepler and K2.

In the following sections we list the main products from Kepler and
K2, and we describe a few of the products in some detail.  For tools
and tips on
inspecting and analyzing Kepler or K2 data, [users should check out this page](software.html).

## Documentation

We encourage users of Kepler and/or K2 data to read through the
documentation associated with the Kepler and K2 data products.
There is documentation specific to the [Kepler data products](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/data_products.html) and to the
[K2 data products](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/data_products.html).

### Kepler data release notes

The prime Kepler mission operated from 2009 May 2 until 2013 May 8,
when a second reaction wheel failed on the spacecraft.  During its
four years of operation, the spacecraft completed a 90 degree roll every 3 months to
optimize solar panel efficiency.  Kepler operations are therefore divided into four quarters each year, separated by the quarterly rolls of the spacecraft.  The table
below lists each operational quarter, the corresponding Guest
Observer (GO) program cycle, the beginning and end dates for data
collection, and the date the data was ingested at the [MAST
archive](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/).

Kepler long cadence (30-min) images and light curves are stored in files that
span a quarter. Short cadence (1-min) images and light curves are
stored in files that span a month.

[All Kepler data release notes can be found at MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/data_release.html).

### K2 data release notes

The table below lists each operational K2 Campaign, the corresponding
Guest Observer (GO) program cycle, the beginning and end dates for
data collection, and the date the data was ingested at the [MAST
archive](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/). The first four Campaigns had GO programs that were not
conducted through NASA Roses and so do not have an official cycle
associated with them.

Note that K2 long cadence (30-min) images are available for each Campaign.
Light curves produced by the Project Office are available for most
Campaigns, excluding 0 and 9 as of August 2018.  Short cadence (1-min) images are also available for each
Campaign, and short cadence light curves are produced for campaigns processed or re-processed since the
start of the <a href="k2-uniform-global-reprocessing-underway.html">K2 global uniform reprocessing effort</a>.

The relevant data release and pipeline notes
for each Campaign are also linked in the table below.  The pipeline release
notes for K2 are
[available here](/k2-pipeline-release-notes.html),
which detail deviations from the pipeline used for Kepler.

## Main data products

A few of the data products from Kepler and K2 are described
below. For a comprehensive list of available products, see the above
lists for [Kepler](data-products.html#kepler-product-overview) and [K2](data-products.html#k2-product-overview).

### Full frame images (FFIs)

The Kepler detector is a photometer with an array of 42 CCDs or 21 modules. The
Kepler field of view spans 115.6 square degrees over 95 million
detector pixels, with 3.98 x 3.98 arcsec pixels. Science
data downloads for Kepler occurred
approximately once per month. Immediately
before each data download, a 29.4 min image of the entire field of
view was collected and transmitted. [These are the Kepler FFIs, which
can be downloaded from a dedicated data retrieval page at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/ffi/search.php).

For K2, typically only two FFIs are collected per Campaign.  [These can
also be downloaded through MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/ffi/search.php).

FFI data format is defined in section 2.3.3 of the [Kepler Archive
Manual](http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/archive_manual.pdf). Note
that as of August 2016, the Kepler detector has three dead modules (3,
4 and
7).

### Target pixel files (TPFs)

The Kepler camera takes one exposure every 6.5s. Exposures are summed
onboard and stored at either 1765.5 s (29.4 min) cadence
(a.k.a. 30 min or long
cadence) or 58.89 s cadence (a.k.a. 1 min or short cadence). At these
data collection cadences, the Solid State Recorder onboard the
spacecraft can store only 5.4 million of the 95 million pixels
available. The pixels collected are chosen strategically to provide
postage stamp images centered on the positions of targets of interest. The size of a postage stamp increases with target brightness
and the average yield was 166,000 targets per month for Kepler.  For
K2 the average yield per Campaign is between 10,000 and 20,000 long
cadence targets and 50 to 100 short cadence targets.

A critical concept for understanding artifact issues in Kepler light
curves is that in order to maximize the target yield, postage stamp
sizes and shapes are chosen to maximize the signal-to-noise on the
3-12 hour timescales of exoplanet transits. Postage stamp pixels are
chosen by a calculation that combines the photometry and astrometry
within the Kepler Input Catalog and an [analytical model](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...713L..97B) for the
detector and optics. Any variation in the position of the target
within the postage stamp or the focus of the telescope will result in
a redistribution of flux within the postage stamp pixels.  Similar
steps are performed for K2 targets.

The target pixel files are the rawest form of target-specific data
available from the Kepler and K2 archives at MAST.  The TPF data format is defined in section 2.3.2 of the [Kepler Archive
Manual](http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/archive_manual.pdf).

Typical images stored within a TPF. The left-hand image is stored in a
time-tagged data table and contains calibrated, background-subtracted
and cosmic ray removed pixel fluxes for one specific timestamp. The
right-hand image contains a bitmap that describes the employment of
each pixel in the Kepler/K2 pipeline. Black pixels were not collected by
the spacecraft, yellow are collected but do not contribute to the
photometry stored in the associated light curve file. White pixels are
included in the photometric aperture that maximizes target
signal-to-noise over nominal observations.

### Light curve files

The light curves are derived from the TPFs. There is a one-to-one
correspondence between the files and timestamps and quality flags
within the two products are identical. The primary data within the
light curve file is Simple Aperture Photometry - a summation of the
calibrated pixels in the TPF.

The nominal spacecraft pointing for the
Kepler mission was typically 20 milli-arcsec over 6.5 hours. Noise
(artifacts) manifest from thermally-driven focus changes, pointing
derivatives and differential velocity aberration. Systematic artifacts
within the light curves are associated with these events and are the
result of both time-dependent light losses falling out of the pixel
apertures and time-dependent contamination of neighboring sources
moving around within the pixel apertures. These effects are greater
for K2 as the pointing is not as stable as for Kepler, due to
low-frequency motion due to solar pressure and subsequent thruster
firings. These cause targets to drift across detector pixels and are
the dominant factor in photometric precision from K2 after photon statistics.

Within the pipeline, artifacts are mitigated for using a derivative of principle component analysis. The product of this analysis is provided within the light curve. It is the prerogative of archive users to determine whether the pipeline mitigation is suitable for their scientific goals or whether manual mitigation will be required.

Light curve files also contain centroid measurements derived from the
TPFs. Since many artifacts are the result of target motion within its
pixel aperture, time-resolved correlations between target flux and
motion provide useful diagnostics of systematic artifacts within the
time series.

The light curve file format is defined in section 2.3.1 of the [Kepler Archive
Manual](http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/archive_manual.pdf). Light
curves are available for all quarters of Kepler data, and as of August 2018, are
available (from the Project Office) for all K2 campaigns besides C0 and C9.

### Collateral data

Collateral data is collected onboard for the purpose of calibrating
science data. Collateral pixels estimate the bias level, dark current
and charge smear that results from shutter-less camera
operation. Pixels are collected around sparse fields in order to
provide background measures. Format and content of the collateral files is
provided in section 2.3.7 of the [Kepler Archive
Manual](http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/archive_manual.pdf). These
files are available for both Kepler and K2.

## Auxiliary data products

Auxiliary data is not collected directly by the spacecraft, but is
derived from spacecraft data. Some of the currently available auxiliary data is
described below.

### Cotrending basis vectors (CBVs)

CBVs are provided for each operational quarter of the mission. These are derived by
the Kepler pipeline from Principle Component Analysis and used to
mitigate for systematic artifacts within the the target light
curves. If Kepler or K2 users see residual systematic problems
within their light curve data, the CBVs can be employed in performing
a manual photometric correction, more tailored towards the users
science. Format and content of the CBV files is provided in
section 2.3.4 of the [Kepler Archive
Manual](http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/archive_manual.pdf). [Software for applying the CBVs
to data can be found here](/ContributedSoftwareKepcotrend.shtml).

### Pixel response functions (PRFs)

The PRFs model the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the telescope with
the pointing stability of the Kepler spacecraft. The PSF varies across
the detector plane. There are three primary uses of the PRFs that
require fitting to either TPF or FFI data.

Format and content of the PRF files is provided in section 2.3.5 of
the [Kepler Archive
Manual](http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/archive_manual.pdf). Note
that PRFs are only available for Kepler.
