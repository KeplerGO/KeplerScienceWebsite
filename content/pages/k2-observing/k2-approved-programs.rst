This page details the targets and programs that have been executed by K2
as part of the `Guest Observer program <k2-proposing-targets.html>`_.

The target list and approved programs are posted on this page
as soon as the mission team has prepared the final target list
for upload to the spacecraft, which happens 1-2 months before the start
of a Campaign.

You can click on the title of each program to read a summary
of the research objectives and view a list of the observed targets.

After data has been released, the
`data release notes <data-products.html#k2-data-release-notes>`_
should be consulted for more comprehensive notes for each Campaign.

Campaign 19
-----------
.. raw:: html

  <p>
    The Campaign 19 target list includes
    <b>33,863 standard long cadence</b>
    and <b>216 standard short cadence</b> targets
    located towards the constellation of Aquarius.
    The Campaign partially overlaps with Campaigns 3 and 12,
    while also surveying ~15 deg<sup>2</sup> of previously unstudied sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    The target list includes the nearby planet systems <b>TRAPPIST-1</b> and <b>GJ 9827</b>.
    These systems host some of the most amenable small planets for atmospheric characterization
    known to date, i.e. TRAPPIST-1 f, GJ 9827 b, and GJ 9827 d.
    The Hubble Space Telescope is scheduled to observe GJ 9827 b on September 16th and 21st, simultaneously with Kepler, obtaining a transmission spectrum to characterize water abundance in the atmosphere. Kepler will provide a unique photometric context to the Hubble observations for the purpose of constraining astrophysical noise such as star spots and provide precise transit modeling when HST is in Earth occultation.
  </p>

    Other notable targets include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Dozens of confirmed and candidate exoplanets</b> previously discovered

.. raw:: html

  <p>
    The Campaign 18 target list includes
    <b>20,419 standard long cadence</b>
    and <b>235 standard short cadence</b> targets
    located towards the constellation of Cancer.
  </p>

  <p>
     The field is almost identical to that observed during Campaign 5
     and overlaps substantially with Campaign 16.
     The third visit to this key part of the sky that contains the M44 and M67 star clusters will enable users to study benchmark targets with a 3-year baseline and 8-month duty cycle, enabling original Kepler-like science at a Galactic sightline that is located 130 degrees away from the original Kepler field in Cygnus.
  </p>

  <p>
    Notable targets include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Two open star clusters</b>:

            (K2-95b, K2-100b, K2-101b, K2-102b, K2-103b, K2-104b).
            Its members are being observed using standard masks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>M67</b> is the benchmark star cluster
            with solar-like age and metallicity.

            using 441 unique 20x20-pixel long cadence aperture masks
            which create a contiguous 420x420 pixel region.
            In addition, hundreds of members in the outskirts
            are being observed using standard masks,
            and more than 40 targets are being observed

Campaign 17
-----------
.. raw:: html

    <p>
        The Campaign 17 target list includes
        <b>34,398 standard long cadence</b>
        and <b>179 standard short cadence</b> targets
        located towards the constellation of Virgo.
        Like Campaigns 9 and 16, this is a forward-facing field which enables
        simultaneous observations to be carried out from the ground.
    </p>

    <p>
        Campaign 17 provides a substantial overlap with Campaign 6,
        offering a longer baseline for stellar activity, asteroseismology,
        and AGN studies,
        as well as enabling dozens of K2 planet candidates to be revisited.
        The field also provides access to 20 deg<sup>2</sup>
        of previously unexplored sky.
    </p>

    <p>
        Notable targets include:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Spica</b>: the brightest star system
            in the constellation of Virgo (V=1),

            The object is being observed using a 40px-diameter circular mask
            (ID 200213067) designed to capture the PSF core and wings
            while excluding the long saturation columns
            which will bleed off silicon.

Campaign 16
-----------
.. raw:: html

    <p>
        Campaign 16 is scheduled to run from
        <b>2017 Dec 7 (~22h UT) through 2018 Feb 25 (~13h UT)</b>.
        The target list includes 29,888 standard long cadence
        and 129 standard short cadence targets
        located towards the constellation of Cancer.
        The list includes <b>20,647 stars alongside
        9,241 galaxies for the <a href="supernova-experiment">supernova experiment</a></b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Uniquely, the spacecraft will be pointing along the forward-facing direction
        of the spacecraft's velocity vector during this Campaign,
        which <b>allows the field to be accessed from Earth</b>.
        This enables K2's single-bandpass photometry
        to be complemented with simultaneous observations from the ground,
        an opportunity that is being utilised by many of the selected programs,
        e.g. to characterize supernovae in the field, and to carry out
        simultaneous high-precision RV observations alongside K2's photometry.
    </p>
    <p>
        The field contains two important clusters: <b>M44 (Beehive) and M67</b>.
        M44 is one of the most nearby open clusters;
        its members are being observed using standard masks.
        M67 is a benchmark cluster with solar-like age and metallicity;
        the stars in its core are being observed using a 400-by-360&nbsp;pixel
        custom mask that covers the same area of the sky
        that was previously covered by a 400-by-400&nbsp;pixel custom mask in Campaign 5,
        except for a 40px-wide strip that is not on silicon in C16.
        In addition, hundreds of members in the outskirts of M67
        are being targeted using standard long cadence masks,
        and 39 members are targeted using short cadence masks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other notable targets in Campaign 16 include:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Dozens of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates revealed by
                K2 Campaign 5</b>,
                including several discovered in the Beehive cluster
                (K2-101b, K2-102b, K2-103b, K2-104b, EPIC 211901114b)
                and the confirmed hot Jupiter K2-34b.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Nearby late-type flare stars</b>
                including LHS 2090 (M6.5), DP Cnc (M3.5),
                DS Cnc (M4), and AZ Cnc (M6).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>9 very bright stars</b> are being observed using custom circular masks,
                including HD 76333 and 45 Cancri in short cadence,
                and α, δ, η, and ξ Cancri in long cadence.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>19 Solar System objects</b> including asteroid Hekate,
                comets 288P and 2009 YD7, 4 Trojan asteroids,
                and 12 Trans-Neptunian Objects.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, a consequence of the forward-facing geometry is that
        our own <b>Earth-Moon system</b> will be moving across the focal
        plane during the first 3.5 days of the Campaign.
        We warn that our planet's passage will add noise to multiple CCD channels
        due to scattered light and saturation effects.
        Ground-based observers may wish to wait for Earth
        to leave the focal plane on 2017-Dec-11 near 6h UT to
        commence their complementary observations.
        By this time, the mission's engineers will also have been
        able to confirm the accuracy of Kepler's pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Earth and Moon will be captured by the first Full Frame Image (FFI),
        which is scheduled for 2017-Dec-10 between 21:30 and 22:00 UT.
        In addition, a narrow custom LC mask will cover Earth's trajectory
        between 2017-Dec-07 17:00 and 2017-Dec-08 03:00 UT,
        which is when Earth will occult the Moon as seen from Kepler.
        Don't forget to smile and wave towards the constellation of Capricornus
        near these times, which is where Kepler will be located while it is
        observing our planet!

    all located in a high-Galactic latitude field (-60&deg;)
    on the boundary between the constellations of Aquarius and Pisces.
    </p>

    <p>
    The short cadence list includes <b>TRAPPIST-1</b>,
    an ultracool dwarf star known to host
    several Earth-sized transiting planets.
    A generous 11-by-11 pixel short cadence mask
    will be used to capture this target (mask ID 200164267).
    </p>

    <p>
    The long cadence list includes <b>2,576 galaxies</b> to enable
    supernovae and AGN studies.
    It also includes <b>8 bright stars</b> (Kp ~5)
    for which we collect only the central region of pixels
    using a circular aperture mask, excluding the long saturation bleed.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, long cadence custom masks were scheduled to observe
    <b>19 Trojan asteroids</b>, <b>9 Trans-Neptunian Objects</b>,
    and <b>4 Comets</b> (90P/Gehrels, 95P/Chiron, 176P/LINEAR, 228P/LINEAR).
    The trajectories of these moving bodies have been tiled

    Most notably, the well-known <b>Centaur 95P/Chiron</b>
    will be observed for the entire duration of the campaign in long cadence
    (mask ID range 200164175–200164266)

Campaign 11
-----------
.. raw:: html

    <p>
    The Campaign 11 target list includes <b>14,209 standard long cadence</b> and <b>65 standard short cadence</b> targets.
    The number of targets is lower than usual because it is a function of the spacecraft's on-board compression efficiency, which is low in the crowded Galactic Bulge field targeted by this Campaign.
    </p>

    <p>
    We gained efficiency by tiling <b>five globular clusters—M9, M19, NGC 6293, NGC 6355, and Terzan 5</b>—which contained a high density of targets requested by multiple programs.
    The latter three clusters will be observed using a circular aperture with 1.6' radius, whilst M9 was targeted using a 2' radius aperture, and M19 will be targeted using a 3'-by-5' rectangular aperture because it fell only partially on silicon.
    </p>

    <p>
    The target list also includes <b>11 very bright stars</b> (Kp magnitudes 3 to 6) for which we target only the central region of pixels using a circular aperture mask, excluding the long saturation bleed.
    Two of the bright stars are observed in short cadence (26 Oph &amp; 36 Oph) and
    the others in long cadence.
    </p>

    <p>
    Finally, we will also observe <b>55 Trojan asteroids</b>, <b>7 Trans-Neptunian Objects</b>, and Saturn's moons <b>Titan and Enceladus</b>.
    The trajectories of these moving bodies have been tiled using 1xn or nx1 pixel strips (EPID IDs 200147375-200147463 for Titan and 200142604-200142897 for Enceladus).
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that this is the first campaign to be executed after the <a href='/retirement-of-ccd-module-4-confirmed.html'>loss of CCD Module 4</a>.
    Targets that were approved but would have fallen on this module were excluded from the target list.
    Only five programs lost more than 10% of their targets as a result,
    and no program lost more than 20%.

Campaign 9b

.. raw:: html

  <p>
  The majority of the Campaign 9 pixel budget was dedicated to
  <a href="k2-c9.html">a study of gravitational microlensing events</a>
  toward the Galactic bulge. The aim of this program was to simultaneously observe gravitational microlensing events with K2 and from Earth in order to see a parallax effect in the shape and time of lensing events.
  A near-contiguous superstamp of 3.7 deg<sup>2</sup> was observed in long cadence for this purpose, covering large swaths of CCD channels 30, 31, 32, 49, and 52 (program ID GO9001).
  Additional custom masks were allocated to capture isolated PRF reference
  stars (GO9002), dark clouds for noise model inference (GO9003),
  and small masks to cover ongoing microlensing events outside the main superstamp (GO9004).
  </p>

  <p>
  The experiment included a three-day, mid-campaign break for data downlinking, splitting the campaign into two halves: C9a and C9b.
  </p>

  <p>
  The remaining part of the pixel budget was made available to the community via the DDT program.  The DDT target list included 1,480 long cadence
  and 12 short cadence masks. Custom targets included
  Kuiper Belt Object Quaoar and a superstamp to cover
  the core of the Lagoon star-forming region (M8).

Campaign 7
----------
.. raw:: html

  <p>
  In Campaign 7 there was a significant drop in the number of targets observed relative to previous campaigns. This drop was because the number of targets we can observe is a function of our on-board compression efficiency. The extremely dense nature of the Campaign 7 field forced us to assume a poorer compression estimate than we used for earlier campaigns. This target list consists of 13,469 standard long cadence and 72 standard short cadence targets. We tiled a region around the open cluster Ruprecht 147 using 60 individual pixel masks. In addition, we included large pixel masks over 3 Trojan/Hilda Asteroids and the (dwarf) planet Pluto. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled just a subset of the pixels that make up the path the Trojans/Hildas move along. These observations are in long cadence. Finally, we also observed 10 very bright stars by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets but excluding the bleed columns.

.. raw:: html

  <p>
  The Campaign 6 target list consists of 28,289 standard long cadence
  and 84 standard short cadence targets. In addition we have included
  large pixel masks over 65 Trojan asteroids. Bodies within our own
  Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered
  by long streaks of pixels. We tiled just a subset of the pixels that
  make up the path the Trojans move along. The Trojans were observed in long cadence.

  <p>
    The Campaign 3 target list consists of 16,375 standard long cadence and 55 standard short cadence targets. In addition we have included large pixel masks over dwarf planet (225088) 2007 OR10, the planet Neptune and its moon Nereid. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled the entire extent of (225088) 2007 OR10, Neptune and Nereid in long cadence, and we have tiled approximate 20 days either side of the stationary point of Neptune in short cadence.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was an error in the software we supplied to the community that reports whether potential targets fall on active silicon. The roll coordinate used in the software was 5 degrees off from the as-flown pointing. The result is that roughly 20% of proposed targets fell off active silicon and were not observable. We backfilled the target list with targets from lower ranked programs. The error was regrettable and we have put steps in place to prevent this happening again.

    by peer-review.  The Campaign 0 target list
    includes the open clusters M35 (NGC 2168) and NGC 2158.  These
    were observed using 154 separate 50x50 pixel masks.

Concept Engineering Test
------------------------
.. raw:: html

  <p>
  Between Feb 4-13, 2014, before Campaign 0, the Kepler spacecraft
  executed a very short engineering test to demonstrate the K2 mission concept
  and its photometric precision.
  The formal name of this data set is the <i>"Two-wheel Concept Engineering Test"</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
  During this nine-day test, the spacecraft observed 2,000 long cadence and 17 short cadence target masks towards a test field located near (ra, dec) = (359&deg;, -2&deg;).
  The masks were centered on a variety of targets selected by the Kepler Science Center, including known planet hosts, eclipsing binaries, variables, hot stars, and cool dwarfs.
  All masks were deliberately designed to be very large,
  measuring 50-by-50 pixels each,
  to enable the K2 pointing performance to be assessed.
  Each mask contains multiple stars in addition to the main target as a result.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Kepler/K2 Science Center does not support this engineering data set
  at the same level as official K2 campaigns,
  e.g. light curve products have not been generated.
  However Target Pixel Files have been made available.
