Title: K2 observing: an overview
Save_as: k2-observing.html

The K2 mission provides the community with an opportunity to continue
Kepler’s ground-breaking discoveries in the field of exoplanets and
expand its role into new and exciting astrophysical observations. A
description of the mission concept and early results can be found in
[Howell et al. 2014](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PASP..126..398H).

K2 observations entail a series of sequential observing
["Campaigns"](k2-fields.html) of fields distributed around the
ecliptic plane. Each ecliptic Campaign is limited by Sun angle
constraints to a duration of approximately 80 days as illustrated in
the image below ([Howell et al. 2014](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PASP..126..398H)). 
Therefore, four to five K2 Campaigns can be performed 
during each 372-day orbit of the spacecraft.

K2 is a community-driven mission. All K2 targets are proposed by the community through the
[Guest Observer program](k2-proposing-targets.html). The K2 mission
welcomes all proposals including, but not exclusive to, exoplanet,
stellar, extragalactic and solar system science.  Since K2 offers a photometric precision approaching that of the original Kepler mission [to within a factor of
approximately two](k2-photometric-performance.html), a variety of scientific goals can be readily
achieved with K2's continuous, high-precision photometry.

### Scientific motivations

The scientific potential spans a wide range of astrophysics.
It is anticipated that K2 will:

* Provide a yield of **hot planets around bright stars** for follow-up transit 
spectroscopy to facilitate rapid advances in the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres.
* Provide a yield of **small planets around bright, small stars** to facilitate the most precise follow-up measurements to date
of masses, densities and compositions.
* Identify locations and characteristics of **potentially-habitable planets
around bright M-dwarfs** in the solar neighborhood.
* Determine if **hot gas giants exist around young stars**,
or whether they migrate to small orbits at a later epoch
by tidal or other interactions.
* Determine the relationship between **stellar structure, rotation and activity** 
within stellar associations over a range of ages and metallicity.
* Identify the progenitors of **Type Ia supernovae**
from photometric structure in the rise to outburst maximum.
* Discover and characterize **binary stars** within open clusters and stellar associations.
* Characterize internal stellar structure and fundamental properties of stars using the tools of **asteroseismology**.
* Provide a large, regular cadence survey of **AGN activity** 
in the optical bandpass.
* Participate in multi-mission, **multi-band monitoring campaigns**
of ecliptic targets along with other space-based hardware or ground-based telescopes.
