## Background

Following a call for novel science experiments to be accomplished during K2's extended mission,
feedback was received to enable a supernova survey
in which simultaneous ground-based spectroscopic observations
could complement K2’s single-bandpass photometry.
A limitation that K2 supernova scientists have faced in previous Campaigns 
is that simultaneous observations from Earth required challenging observations during twilight.
This will change in Campaigns 16 and 17, when K2 will observe fields towards the 
forward direction of its velocity vector,
enabling galaxies to be monitored in a field
that can easily be accessed from the ground at the same time.

The large sample of supernova light curves expected from this experiment
will improve the calibration of Type Ia supernovae for cosmology 
by reducing uncertainties in distance measurements. 
By determining the key parameters needed for distance fitting 
(light-curve width and maximum luminosity), 
K2 observations will improve the precision of distances 
that are used for H<sub>0</sub> and constraints on dark energy.

Moreover, traditional ground-based supernova searches
tend to find most supernovae only at or past maximum light.
In contrast, K2's continuous high-cadence observations will capture the early phases of events.
There is clearly a tremendous amount of information about the explosion contained 
in the early rise of the light curve.
For example, for Type II supernovae these curves may reveal the shock breakout (see figure below).
For Type Ia supernovae, the data may help elucidate the unknown trigger mechanism.
For example, if a mass-losing companion star is present, then when the expanding material from the supernova hits it, 
extra shock emission will be evident (e.g. <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0275'>Kasen 2010</a>).
That emission, occurring in the first several days and dependent on viewing angle, 
requires early and continual observing of many supernovae to clearly define the circumstances of the shock 
and discover the progenitors of the events.
The K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment will deliver a statistical sample of such observations.

## K2 Supernova Workshop

The K2 mission will host a **Supernova Workshop on Feb 14-16, 2017**,
at NASA Ames in Mountain View, California.
The motivations for this workshop include:

* providing an opportunity to plan the K2 observations with Kepler/K2 team members;
* coordinating the simultaneous, ground-based follow-up observations and proposals;
* preparing the data analysis and interpretation efforts, e.g. informed by the previous supernovae observed by Kepler;
* exploring synergies with other space missions, wavelength regions, and  science areas.


### Dates & schedule

The workshop will begin on Tuesday, February 14, at 10am and end on Thursday, February 16, at 5pm.

This will be an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference'>unconference-style</a>
meeting with a limited number of
introductory talks and a strong focus on participant-led breakout sessions.
The final day will provide time for drafting observing proposals and papers.

### Venue

The workshop will take place at the
<a href='https://www.google.com/maps/place/NASA+Ames+Conference+Center-NACC,+Building+152,+200+Bailey+Rd,+Mountain+View,+CA+94043/@37.4075789,-122.059327,17z'>NASA Ames Conference Center (Building 152)</a>,
in Mountain View, California.

Access to the NASA Ames requires a valid form of ID to be shown at the main gate.
Non US-citizens will be required to pick up a badge at the
<a href='https://www.google.com/maps/@37.4098037,-122.063085,19z'>main gate</a> and
need to register **before January 9th** for this reason.

The nearest airport is the San Jose International Airport (SJC).
The nearest alternative to SJC is San Francisco International Airport (SFO).
We recommend hiring a rental car or using the Uber or Lyft apps
for transportation from the airport.


### Accommodation

On-site accommodation is available for this meeting
at the <a href='http://naccenter.arc.nasa.gov/links.php#lodge'>NASA Lodge</a>,
which offers affordable rooms with private bath, microwave, and refrigerator
in one of two buildings:

* <a href='https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nasa+Exchange+Lodge/@37.4108933,-122.0594741,18z'>Building 19</a>
  offers queen-sized beds with tv and airconditioning at $65/night;
* <a href='https://www.google.com/maps/place/NASA+Exchange+Lodge+-+583A,+583A+Dailey+Rd,+Mountain+View,+CA+94043/@37.4085436,-122.0566298,18.25z'>Building 583</a>
 offers double or twin beds without tv or airconditioning at $55/night.

Bookings need to be made by phone on **+1 650 603 7100**,
mentioning you are a participant of the "Supernova Workshop"
at the conference center.
You will need to provide a credit card number
along with your name, cell phone number, and email.

The workshop secured a block-booking of 25 rooms in Building 19,
which will be made available on a first-come, first-served basis.
Book early to avoid disappointment.

Alternatively, the conference center provides a <a href='http://naccenter.arc.nasa.gov/links.php#hotel'>list of local hotels</a>.
