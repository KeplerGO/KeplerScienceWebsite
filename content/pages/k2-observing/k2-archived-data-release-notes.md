<h2>Features and Events</h2>

***Clusters and Star Forming Regions***

The C13 field of view encompasses part of the Taurus star forming region,
including the well
known T-Tauri stars HL Tau (EPIC 210690913) and LkCa 15 (EPIC 247520207).
The field of view also covers a portion of the
Hyades star cluster along with the distant clusters
NGC 1647, NGC 1746, and NGC 1817.

<br>

***Galaxies***

There are 33 galaxies targeted in the C13 field of view.


<br>

***Pointing and Roll Performance***

The C13 pointing and roll behavior are within the limits of that seen
in other K2 campaigns for the majority of the campaign.
The pipeline calculated maximum distance between the
derived and nominal positions for any target (the "maximum attitude residual", or MAR)
for C13 is well under the 3-pixel limit accommodated by the aperture halos,
except for three periods with anomalous thruster firings. One is in the first day
of the campaign lasting for 6 hours starting at 2017-03-08 17:46:06 UTC
(cadence numbers 140911-140922).
Two periods of anomalous pointing occur in the final five days
of the campaign: 18 hours starting at 2017-05-23 12:11:44 UTC
(cadence numbers 144619-144654), and 6 hours
starting at 2017-05-25 11:16:28 UTC (cadence numbers 144715-144726).
These anomalous thruster firing events occurring near the start and end of campaigns
are suspected to be due to low fuel levels. The flight team is investigating them in
an effort to understand whether they can be mitigated and how they might
evolve in future campaigns.

***Smear Correction Error on Channel 74***

The presence of the first magnitude star Aldebaran on channel 73 led to an error in
the smear correction for channel 74, which shares the same physical CCD (see figure
Aldebaran).
The saturated charge from Aldebaran spills over all rows of the image and into the
serial register of the CCD, corrupting the first three rows of the masked smear region
in the FFI. While these rows are not used for the smear correction, at times during
C13 the saturation spill covered more rows in the masked smear, extending up to row 15 on
channel 74 (see figure Channel 74 Trailing Black). Trailing black rows 7-18 are fit
with a linear model to estimate the black (bias) level for the masked smear region.

At these times,
the trailing black estimate for the masked smear signal was corrupted, resulting in a
corrupted smear measurement for the affected cadences. Since the smear signal is subtracted
from all the pixels in the channel, all targets on channel 74 were affected for these
cadences. The impact is somewhat mitigated by background correction, but due to the
non-linearity correction during calibration, a residual error remains. The effect is
generally more significant for faint targets; however, users are cautioned
to estimate the impact on their science of using data from the affected cadences.
In addition, due to the rapidly changing background estimate, the argabrightening
detector (see [Kepler Data Characteristics Handbook, Sec 5.8](http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/Data_Characteristics.pdf))
was triggered on channel 74 resulting in data gaps in the light curve files for
some targets. Users should treat the channel specific argabrightening indicator
in QUALITY and SAP_QUALITY flags with caution
(bit 13, decimal=4096).

The smear corruption effects were most prominent in the
first 80 cadences of the campaign and again in the period between cadence 1800-3200
(see Figure Channel 74 Trailing Black)
In order to allow users to select the cadences they wish to exclude, the attached
csv file <a href="images/release-notes/c13/c13_ch74_black_for_smear_residuals.csv">c13_ch74_black_for_smear_residuals.csv</a>
contains the residual black level for the masked smear pixels after model fitting for
each LC.
The units of the residual signal are ADU/LC/pixel. The cadences with large negative
residuals (<-200 ADU/LC/pixel) and those showing bimodal behavior are indicative of
a poor model fit and a corrupted smear correction.

<h2>Data Quality and Processing Notes</h2>

***Light Curve Quality***

As in previous campaigns, the 6-hour spacecraft roll cycle continues
to dominate the systematic
errors in C13 simple aperture photometry light curves.
Similar to C12, the pipeline CDPP 12th magnitude noise
benchmark is 15-20% higher than what was seen in star fields of comparable star
density (e.g. C4, C5). There is tentative evidence that at least part of this increase
is due to the anomalous pointing excursions at the beginning and end of the campaign.
In future campaigns, the processing will exclude such cadences from PDC and from
the CDPP estimates.

The magnitude dependence of CDPP and its distribution over the focal
plane are shown below. Other CDPP benchmarks can be found in the
<a href="images/release-notes/c13/c13_bin1.00_sc1.00_CDPP_Summary_17080715.txt">

<h2>Features and events</h2>

<br>
***Solar Activity***

During C2 Kepler experienced two energetic particle events of note, likely caused by solar activity. Both events affected all channels as can be seen in the dark current metric plot for the first 26 days of C2 (see below). The first was a broad peak lasting approximately from cadence 95924 -- 96335 (01-Sep-2014 11:51:30 Z [MJD: 56901.4941] to 09-Sep-2014 21:24:55 Z [MJD: 56909.8923]). The second was a stronger more-peaked event lasting approximately from cadence 96357 -- 96551 (10-Sep-2014 17:01:54 Z [56910.7096] to 14-Sep-2014 07:20:35 Z [56914.30596]). At the peak of the 10-Sep-2014 event the average dark current increased by a factor of ~7 over the quiescent level. The GOES x-ray flux plot for this time shows an increased x-ray flux at Earth, though we don't have an independent measure of the exact timing and magnitude at the location of Kepler. The impact to the data will be in the form of increased background level, and increased photometric noise. The impact will be largest for faint targets.

</div>


<br>
***Mars***

Mars passed across the field of view between October 1 and October 23. See the figure below for a prediction of where Mars is on the focal plane during Campaign 2. Mars is a bright object which will saturate the CCD. Both its image and its reflection will likely contaminate nearby stars.

    </a>
</div>


<br>
***LDE Flags***

During the latter half of C2 we experienced a large number of parity errors coming from the photometer's local detector electronics (LDE). These LDE parity errors can occur when a very bright star saturates and spills charge into the CCD serial readout register, causing an overflow at the input to the analog-to-digital converter. While these errors were rare in Kepler, the very bright stars, or solar system planets, on the focal plane in K2 can cause frequent parity errors. For example, stars on channels 67 and 75 were the source of many of the parity errors during C2. These errors do not affect the quality of data from pixels on the active focal plane.

The LDE parity error triggers a flag (bit 15, decimal=16384) in the QUALITY column of the target pixel files. This flag is set for the majority of cadences in the second half of the campaign.

<br>
***Attitude Tweak***

The pointing of the spacecraft was adjusted by approximately 10" on 2014-Aug-25, during cadence 95546, in order to ensure that the observed targets were centered in their masks. This event is flagged in the QUALITY column of the target pixel files with bit 1 (decimal=1). The data collected before the tweak may fall close to the edge of the collected mask and some of the object's flux may have been lost. Use these cadences with caution.
Note, in Data Release 4, because of an operator error, the tweak is marked on the previous cadence, 95545.

<br>
***Two Globular Clusters***

The clusters M4 and M80 were observed in C2 by collecting all the pixels in 50x50 pixel masks. For M4, 16 of these custom apertures were collected and for M80, 4 were collected. The data files for M4 range from 200004370 -- 200004385. The data files for M80 range from 200004386 -- 200004389. The target pixel files may be found by using the Object Type field on the <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/data_search/search.php">MAST K2 data search</a> page.

<br>
***Two Solar System Objects***

Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) was observed by obtaining 2583, 25x1 pixel, masks across module.outputs 2.3, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4. These apertures were given custom aperture numbers ranging from 200001787 -- 200004369. This target was observed as part of the Guest Observer Programs GO2030 (PI:Kelley) and GO2046 (PI:Lisse).

The Trans-Neptunian Object (268361) 2007 JJ43 was observed with 661, 11x1 or 13x1 pixel, masks and given custom aperture numbers ranging from 200001126 -- 200001786. This target was observed as part of Guest Observer Program GO2066 (PI:Schwamb).

These data sets can be found at the <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/data_search/search.php">MAST</a> by entering the Investigation ID on the search form. The Investigation ID matches the GO Program number that requested the observations.

<br>
***EPIC Catalog Assignment***

For C2, a number of targets were proposed without <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic.pdf">EPIC</a> ID numbers. If a target was observed, it was either 1) given an EPIC ID number from the regular catalog if that target matched a target in the catalog, or 2) assigned a new EPIC ID. We created EPIC ID numbers for 69 targets, ranging from 210282492 -- 210282560.
