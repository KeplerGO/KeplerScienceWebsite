Welcome to the home page of the Kepler & K2 Science Conference IV! Over the past 8 years, high-precision photometry from the Kepler/K2 mission has enabled breakthrough discoveries in exoplanet science, asteroseismology, eclipsing binary stars, solar-system objects, and extragalactic science. To celebrate the legacy and latest science results of Kepler/K2 we invite the community to the 4th Kepler & K2 Science Conference, hosted at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, CA. We welcome contributions from any area of science related to the Kepler/K2 mission, as well as related future missions such as TESS. We are looking forward to celebrating the Kepler/K2 science and legacy with the community!

### Registration & Abstract Submission

*The SOC and LOC are committed to enabling the broadest possible participation by members of the Kepler/K2 community. If you have any questions or concerns regarding your ability to attend please contact the SOC and LOC chairs (Eric Agol at agol@astro.washington.edu, Daniel Huber at huberd@hawaii.edu, and Mark Messersmith at mark.d.messersmith@nasa.gov).*
 
**[Registration is now closed](http://catcopy.ipac.caltech.edu/ksc2017/registration.php)**. There is no registration
fee. When registering, we ask that all participants read and agree
with the <a
href='../code.html'>code of conduct</a>. Upon registering,
participants can also volunteer to judge
a poster competition and/or give a public lecture
the week of the conference. Winners of the poster competition have the
opportunity to give short talks about their results in a dedicated
session in the second half of the conference. Poster judges will rank
posters of conference participants who agreed to enter the
competition. Additional details on the poster competition are
forthcoming. Also, the opportunity to give a public lecture
is open to people at all professional
levels (graduate students, postdocs, etc.).

**[Abstract submission is now closed](http://catcopy.ipac.caltech.edu/ksc2017/abstract.php)**. Multiple
  abstract submissions are allowed. Note that Wednesday afternoon
  (June 21) has been reserved for breakout sessions to enable the
  community to discuss and work on Kepler/K2 related projects. We
  envision that these sessions will be more hands-on ("unconference"
  sessions) compared to traditional talks, ideally with broad interest
  to the community. Examples for breakout sessions could include panel
  discussions, hack activities, work meetings of larger
  collaborations, or tutorials to use data/software products related
  to Kepler/K2. To submit a proposal for a breakout session please
  select the appropriate abstract preference during registration.

### Travel Support

Limited financial support for travel expenses is available for those
who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. Special
consideration will be given to graduate students and postdoctoral
associates. Priority will be given to requests placed on or before the
deadline for abstract submissions (March 31, 2017). Late requests will
be accepted but will be limited by the availability of funds.

Depending upon the demonstrated need and the volume of requests, awarded support (in the form of expense reimbursement) may include one or more of the following:

* Lodging
* Meals
* Airfare
* Ground Transportation

**[We are no longer accepting applications for travel support](https://goo.gl/forms/vsrCGGcdNTqqHFF92)**.

#### ExoPAG 16 Meeting

The ExoPAG 16 meeting will be held immediately prior to the conference on June 18, 2017.  We encourage all attendees of the main conference to arrive a day early to sunny Mountain View, California to attend the ExoPAG meeting and learn the latest news regarding planned and future exoplanet exploration.  The meeting is open to the entire scientific community and there is no registration fee.  For further information, [access the meeting website here](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/events/191/).

### Venue 

The conference will be held in the

There is a small room off the auxiliary conference room that can be
reserved for breakout meetings and/or nursing. The room will have a
sign-up sheet so the desired time for meetings/nursing can be selected.

Access to NASA Ames requires a valid form of ID to be shown at the
main gate. Non US-citizens will be required to pick up a badge at the
<a href='https://www.google.com/maps/@37.4098037,-122.063085,19z'>main
gate</a>.

#### Travel Information

The nearest airport is the San Jose International Airport (SJC).
The nearest alternative to SJC is San Francisco International Airport
(SFO).  While a bit further, flying into Oakland International Airport (OAK) is
also another option.
We recommend hiring a rental car or using the Uber or Lyft apps
for transportation from the airport.

#### Lodging Options

*<b> We have received reports of some registrants receiving phone
 calls from hotels in the Bay Area (including, e.g. a person claiming
 to be from the County Inn).  The caller was attempting to pressure
 the registrant into making hotel reservations as room rates were
 supposedly going up soon.  We (the conference LOC) have no
 arrangements with any hotels in regards to this information, and we
 greatly apologize for any inconvenience.  If you do receive a call
 like this, please be aware that this is a scam and do not give them
 any further information. </b>*
