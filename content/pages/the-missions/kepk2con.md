Welcome to the home page of the Kepler & K2 Science Conference IV! Over the past 8 years, high-precision photometry from the Kepler/K2 mission has enabled breakthrough discoveries in exoplanet science, asteroseismology, eclipsing binary stars, solar-system objects, and extragalactic science. To celebrate the legacy and latest science results of Kepler/K2 we invite the community to the 4th Kepler & K2 Science Conference, hosted at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, CA. We welcome contributions from any area of science related to the Kepler/K2 mission, as well as related future missions such as TESS. We are looking forward to celebrating the Kepler/K2 science and legacy with the community!

### Registration & Abstract Submission

*The SOC and LOC are committed to enabling the broadest possible participation by members of the Kepler/K2 community. If you have any questions or concerns regarding your ability to attend please contact the SOC and LOC chairs (Eric Agol at agol@astro.washington.edu, Daniel Huber at huberd@hawaii.edu, and Mark Messersmith at mark.d.messersmith@nasa.gov).*
 
**[Registration is now closed for general participants.  Press can still register at this link](http://catcopy.ipac.caltech.edu/ksc2017/registration.php)**. There
is no registration
fee. When registering, we ask that all participants read and agree
with the <a
href='../code.html'>code of conduct</a>. Upon registering,
participants can also volunteer to judge
a poster competition and/or give a public lecture
the week of the conference. Winners of the poster competition have the
opportunity to give short talks about their results in a dedicated
session in the second half of the conference. Poster judges will rank
posters of conference participants who agreed to enter the
competition. Additional details on the poster competition are
forthcoming. Also, the opportunity to give a public lecture
is open to people at all professional
levels (graduate students, postdocs, etc.).

**[Abstract submission is now closed](http://catcopy.ipac.caltech.edu/ksc2017/abstract.php)**. Multiple
  abstract submissions are allowed. Note that Wednesday afternoon
  (June 21) has been reserved for breakout sessions to enable the
  community to discuss and work on Kepler/K2 related projects. We
  envision that these sessions will be more hands-on ("unconference"
  sessions) compared to traditional talks, ideally with broad interest
  to the community. Examples for breakout sessions could include panel
  discussions, hack activities, work meetings of larger
  collaborations, or tutorials to use data/software products related
  to Kepler/K2. To submit a proposal for a breakout session please
  select the appropriate abstract preference during registration.

### Travel Support

Limited financial support for travel expenses is available for those
who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. Special
consideration will be given to graduate students and postdoctoral
associates. Priority will be given to requests placed on or before the
deadline for abstract submissions (March 31, 2017). Late requests will
be accepted but will be limited by the availability of funds.

Depending upon the demonstrated need and the volume of requests, awarded support (in the form of expense reimbursement) may include one or more of the following:

* Lodging
* Meals
* Airfare
* Ground Transportation

**[We are no longer accepting applications for travel support](https://goo.gl/forms/vsrCGGcdNTqqHFF92)**.

#### ExoPAG 16 Meeting

The ExoPAG 16 meeting will be held immediately prior to the conference on June 18, 2017.  We encourage all attendees of the main conference to arrive a day early to sunny Mountain View, California to attend the ExoPAG meeting and learn the latest news regarding planned and future exoplanet exploration.  The meeting is open to the entire scientific community and there is no registration fee.  For further information, [access the meeting website here](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/events/191/).

#### Participant List

<a href='../participants.html'>A list of registered participants can
be found here</a>.

#### Venue Information

The conference will be held in the
<a href='https://www.google.com/maps/place/NASA+Ames+Conference+Center-NACC,+Building+152,+200+Bailey+Rd,+Mountain+View,+CA+94043/@37.4075789,-122.059327,17z'>NASA Ames Conference Center (Building 152)</a>,
in Mountain View, California.

There is a small room off the auxiliary conference room that can be
reserved for breakout meetings and/or nursing. The room will have a
sign-up sheet so the desired time for meetings/nursing can be selected.

#### Directions to Venue

Access to NASA Ames requires a valid form of ID to be shown.

Anyone in a vehicle should use the Ellis Gate entrance off of
Highway 101.  The Moffett Field Gate is accessible to foot traffic and
bicycles only.  (It will look daunting, but pathways are there.)
Please do not park at the Moffett Field Gate; it is a limited area at this time due to construction.
 
At either entrance, stop at the guard station, show your ID, and state you are attending the Kepler Science Conference in Building 152.  There is no need to stop at the badging office.
 
Try to arrive early on the first day; Mondays can be clogged with
traffic and the Ellis entrance is a major Silicon Valley hub (Juniper
Networks, Google Tech Corners, Amazon Labs and NetApps to name a few, are
located nearby).

<a
href='http://bit.ly/2sLZbyv'>A map showing the route to the conference venue from the Ellis gate can be found at this
link</a>.

Attendees can drive into Ames and park at lots near Building
152. There is no cost to park.

#### Presenter Information

We encourage all presenters to use color-blind friendly figures
in their talk and poster presentations. Resources to produce
color-blind friendly presentations include
[this website](http://www.vischeck.com/) and [this website](http://colororacle.org/index.html).

**Talks**

The length for invited talks is 25 minutes + 5 minutes for questions,
and contributed talks have 12 minutes + 3 minutes for
questions.

Note that the projectors can handle both 16:9 and 4:3
format. Presenters should provide their presentations to the check-in desk located in the auditorium as soon as possible, but no later than during the break prior to the session in which the talk is being given.

Talks at the Kepler/K2 science conference will be streamed as well as recorded for future viewing. If you have any materials which aren’t appropriate for dissemination via streaming and/or a recorded talk — or have any other concerns about streaming/recording your presentation, please email Jessie Dotson at jessie.dotson@nasa.gov.

**Posters**

All posters must be approved by the SOC – no late or extra
posters are allowed due to space limitations.

Posters should be no larger than 42'' x 42''
(106 cm x 106 cm). Poster numbers will be placed in the upper corner
of each poster board. This number corresponds to the number assigned
to each poster as given in the conference agenda.

All posters will be up for the entire duration of the meeting. Posters can be mounted starting at
8:00 AM PST on Monday, June 19th and should be taken down by 4:00 PM
PST Friday, June 23rd.

Each author is responsible for mounting his/her material prior to
the opening of the poster session and for removing it at the end of
the meeting.   We will leave six pins at each poster site with a box
of pins located beneath the easels throughout the room in order for
you to mount your poster.

If you are not planning on taking your
poster with you at the end of the conference, please put it in a blue
recycling bin in the corner of the room prior to your departure.  The
Kepler/K2 mission will not assume responsibility for materials left
behind.

**Poster Competition**

Registration for the poster competition for graduate students and postdocs will open at the registration desk on Monday morning. Each participant should mark their poster with a sticker which will be provided at the registration desk. Competition winners will be notified on Wednesday evening and will present a 5 min talk (+2 min for questions) in Session 2 on Friday.

### Lodging Options

*<b> We have received reports of some registrants receiving phone
 calls from hotels in the Bay Area (including, e.g. a person claiming
 to be from the County Inn).  The caller was attempting to pressure
 the registrant into making hotel reservations as room rates were
 supposedly going up soon.  We (the conference LOC) have no
 arrangements with any hotels in regards to this information, and we
 greatly apologize for any inconvenience.  If you do receive a call
 like this, please be aware that this is a scam and do not give them
 any further information. </b>*
