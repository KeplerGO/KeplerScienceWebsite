### Rationale

The quantity and quality of time-series observations of stars has grown profoundly over the last decade, driven in large part by the Kepler/K2 mission.  These data have catalyzed new research avenues within the collection of research topics broadly referred to as "stellar activity".  This workshop aims to assemble practitioners of stellar activity data analysis with a goal of advancing the field to a new era of *precision stellar activity*-- the ability to quantify dynamic surface processes on stars with enhanced predictive power.  We will reserve a large fraction of the time for unstructured innovation following the success of the Astro Data Hack Week, Gaia Sprints, and PyAstro.


The workshop will focus on several hallmark themes of stellar activity that can be addressed with existing Kepler/K2 data in conjunction with ancillary datasets:
1. Constraining starspot and facula coverage fractions and their temperature contrasts
2. Exoplanets and eclipsing binaries as tomographic probes of stellar surfaces
3. Gaussian process regression in the time-domain
4. Contemporaneous lightcurve and multi-epoch spectroscopic monitoring
5. Atmospheric depth effects and the suppression of convective blueshift in high resolution spectroscopy
6. Aggregated and incoherent signals from granulation and flicker
7. Customizing K2 detrending to preserve astrophysical signals of interest
8. Evaluating heuristic methods with synthetic data / building predictive models


### Intended participants

We are targeting data analysis practitioners in the subfield of stellar activity.  The participants should have---or seek---expertise in high precision time series data analysis and/or stellar astrophysics.
