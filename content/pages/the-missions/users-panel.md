Title: K2 Users' Panel
Save_as: users-panel.html

The K2 mission has developed a K2 Users' Panel (K2UP), whose role is to represent the voice of the community in regards to mission science, management policies, and products from the project. Specifically, the panel will:

* provide input on data products and documentation from the mission,
* review the mission's science balance for the remaining observing campaigns,
* define what products are needed to preserve the legacy of the
  mission, and
* recommend new services and identify current services that are superfluous.

The panel will report to the K2 Project Scientist and K2 Program Scientists a few times a year via telecon and/or meetings held at NASA Ames Research Center and/or major conferences. We anticipate members will serve on the K2UP for a term of at least one year.
