Save_as: code.html

The community of participants at astronomical meetings and in astronomical research is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others both inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to maintain a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community. 

As members of the community,

* We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or gender identity, disability, physical  appearance, body size, race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not appropriate. We will treat those outside our community with the same respect as people within our community.

* We pledge that all discussions between members of the community should be done with respect, and we pledge to take proactive measure to ensure that all participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely express their opinions. 

* We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct and to act accordingly when we note violations. 

This code of conduct applies to all community situations, including conferences, associated social events, on social media, and one-on-one interactions.

This statement has been adapted from the Astropy Community Code of Conduct.

 If you have concerns, suggestions, or would like to report a violation, please contact Mark D. Messersmith at 650-793-5722 or Jessie Dotson at 650-701-7040.
