### Summary

The K2 Mission and Boston University will host a **Dwarf Stars and Clusters Workshop on Jan 16-18, 2018**,
at BU in Boston, Massachusetts.

Since its launch in 2009, the Kepler telescope has been providing high precision photometric time series on half a million
targets, from exoplanet hosts to active dwarf stars. With its focus on the ecliptic plane, the K2 Mission has further
expanded science opportunities, especially in the area of stellar clusters and magnetic activity. By the end of 2017, K2
will have observed more than 15 open clusters and associations, some on more than one occasion. The resulting data have
enabled ground-breaking research on a number of topics, including gyrochronology, stellar rotation and activity, planet
occurrence rates, young stellar objects, and eclipsing binary systems. Astronomers working in these areas are warmly
invited to gather for discussion at BU this coming January.

The motivations for this workshop include:

* Summarizing the science done to date with K2 in the area of cool stars, star formation regions, and open clusters.
* Forging new collaborations for future science with K2.
* Exploring synergies with other space missions (especially TESS), wavelength regions, and science areas.


### Agenda

This will be a small workshop (space is limited to ~50 people) with time for most participants to give a short 
overview of their research during the first two days. (There will not be any posters.) We have reserved the final morning 
for "hack day" activities, including data how-to's and high-level science product creation overviews. We will also 
encourage participants to spend time comparing technical approaches to K2 data, including photometry.

The goal of the first day will be to review the science that has been done with K2 and generate ideas for the hack day.
