## Publication database

The Guest Observer office curates a list of scientific publications
pertaining to Kepler and K2.
The database contains 2426 publications,
of which 2138 are peer-reviewed.
It demonstrates the important impact of Kepler/K2 data
on astronomical research.

You can access the publication list by mission:

 * <a href="kpub-kepler.html">Kepler publications &raquo;</a>
 * <a href="kpub-k2.html">K2 publications &raquo;</a>

Or by topic:

 * <a href="kpub-exoplanets.html">Exoplanet publications &raquo;</a>
 * <a href="kpub-astrophysics.html">Astrophysics publications &raquo;</a>

If you spot an error in the database, such as a missing entry,
please get in touch or open an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/kpub">GitHub repository</a> of the database.
