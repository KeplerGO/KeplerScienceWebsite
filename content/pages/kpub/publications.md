[TOC]

We request that scientific publications using data obtained from the Kepler
or K2 projects include one of the following acknowledgments:

*This paper includes data collected by the Kepler mission. Funding for
the Kepler mission is provided by the NASA Science Mission
directorate.*

*This paper includes data collected by the K2 mission. Funding for
the K2 mission is provided by the NASA Science Mission
directorate.*

## Publication database

The Guest Observer office curates a list of scientific publications
pertaining to Kepler and K2.
The database contains 3560 publications,
of which 3212 are peer-reviewed.
It demonstrates the important impact of Kepler/K2 data
on astronomical research.

You can access the publication list by mission:

 * <a href="kpub-kepler.html">Kepler publications &raquo;</a>
 * <a href="kpub-k2.html">K2 publications &raquo;</a>

Or by topic:

 * <a href="kpub-exoplanets.html">Exoplanet publications &raquo;</a>
 * <a href="kpub-astrophysics.html">Astrophysics publications &raquo;</a>

You also can mine the database yourself by accessing a spreadsheet of the publications: [kepler-publications.xls](/data/kepler-publications.xls)

If you spot an error, such as a missing entry,
please get in touch or open an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/kpub">GitHub repository</a> of the database.

<hr/>

## Number of authors

The entries in the publication database have been authored and co-authored
by a total of 5800 unique author names.
We define the author name at "last name, first initial".
Slight variations in the spelling may increase the number of unique names,
while common names with the same first initial may result in undercounting.

<hr/>

## Breakdown by subject

Both Kepler and K2 data have been used for scientific applications
that reach far beyond exoplanet research.
While 1667 works relate to exoplanets
(47%),
a total of 1893
pertain to other areas of astrophysics
(53%).

The graph below details the breakdown of K2 papers by science topic.
