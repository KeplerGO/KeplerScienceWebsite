The K2 observations will be used to determine its orbital period, to constrain the binary parameter, and to probe the re-start of mass transfer following the nova eruption."

These targets are used to check the pointing is nominal. Only one proposed target was suitable in C9 so the project selected two additional targets: 226557170 and 225576868. These targets are assigned masks of 25x25 pixels."
