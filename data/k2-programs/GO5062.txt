# Summary of K2 Program GO5062

Title: Cataclysmic Variables for K2's Campaign 4 and 5

PI: Schlegel, Eric M (University of Texas-San Antonio)
CoIs: Honeycutt, R. Kent

Campaign 5 of the Kepler2 mission will cover the location of the bright, eclipsing nova-like cataclysmic variable AC Cnc.  The Kepler mission has studied only two eclipsing systems, both of the dwarf nova sub-class.  Eclipsing CVs are important because the observations define the system parameters and provide a probe of the accretion disk.  Nova-likes are important because they exhibit the properties of high-accretion rate systems.  AC Cnc will be the first eclipsing novalike to be observed.  A recent model for the flickering observed in high-accretion rate CVs can be directly tested with an eclipsing system.
