Title: Monitoring the Closest Stars in K2 Fields 8 and 10

The fundamentals of stellar astronomy are built upon studies of nearby
stars. Because of their proximity and brightness, they provide us with
the most reliable answers to questions about stellar populations,
multiplicity, structure, and evolution.  These nearby stars have
accurate optical/infrared photometry in addition to accurate
parallaxes, so we know their precise locations on the HR
diagram. Using the combination of available parallaxes and photometry,
we will answer a fundamental question in stellar astronomy: What
stellar parameters of K and M dwarfs cause the main sequence (MS) to
be up to three full magnitudes in width? In order to answer this
question, we need to understand their multiplicity,
metallicities/ages, variability characteristics, radii, and rotation
rates.  The RECONS team has initiated programs to understand the
relation between the MS width and different stellar parameters
discussed above. Because of the limited precision on the ground based
observations to measure rotation periods, we propose to utilize the K2
mission to observe the sample of the nearest K and M dwarfs within 25
pc to accurately determine their rotation rates. In K2 fields 8 and
10, we will observe seven nearby systems, including three K and four M dwarfs. We expect to have the most complete characterization of a set of the nearest K and M stars in all K2 fields that has ever been accomplished.
