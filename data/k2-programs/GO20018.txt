# Summary of K2 Program GO20018

Title: A Potential Benchmark Eclipsing Binary Star

PI: Pepper, J. (Lehigh University)
CoIs: M. Johnson, J. Labadie-Bartz, X. Yao, R. Siverd

We have identified an unusual eclipsing binary star system observable in C20, and we wish to obtain a highly precise light curve from K2 in order to derive fundamental stellar parameters and explore the variability properties of the system. The binary system has a low-mass primary star with the possibility of mass transfer and signs of youth.
