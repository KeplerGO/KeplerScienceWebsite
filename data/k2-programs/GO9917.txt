# Summary of K2 Program GO9917

Title: K2 short-cadence characterization of the unusually slow nova V5558 Sgr

PI: GÃ¤nsicke, Boris (University of Warwick)
CoIs: 

We propose to obtain the first short-cadence K2 observations a classical nova: V5558 Sgr erupted in 2007 and is a very rare example of a thermonuclear runaway on a low-mass white dwarf. The K2 observations will be used to determine its orbital period, to constrain the binary parameter, and to probe the re-start of mass transfer following the nova eruption.
