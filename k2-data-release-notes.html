<h2>Features and events</h2>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Uranus</em></strong></br></p>
<p>Uranus and four of its moons were observed with custom masks during Campaign 8. The path of Uranus was tiled with 245 single column target definitions at long cadence and with nine 9 x 307 trapezoidal masks at short cadence. The moons Caliban, Prospero, Setebos, and Sycorax were observed with separate custom masks. Uranus is the brightest moving object yet observed by K2. </p>

<p><br>
<strong><em>Galaxies</em></strong></br></p>
<p>With its high Galactic latitude, Campaign 8 was ideal for observing galaxies. There were 2750 galaxies targeted, including IC 1613 (Caldwell 51), an irregular dwarf galaxy in the Local Group. IC 1613 was tiled with 48 20 x 20 pixel masks for a total of 19,200 pixels. </p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Roll Drift Returns to <em>Normal</em></em></strong></br></p>
<p>Based on the C7 degraded roll performance, the Mission Operations Center switched back to low-gain antenna LGA1 for spacecraft communication during most of C8. The switch resulted in a return to nominal K2 roll performance and drift rates. The campaign was started using LGA2, as was used in C7, and then starting around 23 Jan 2016 23:50 UTC operations were switched to LGA1. The antenna swap can be seen in the roll drift attitude error. </p>

<div class="caption">
<i>Figure C8-Pointing History: With the change back to using low-gain antenna LGA1 for communications, the roll drift (or x-axis attitude error) returned to nominal K2 behavior after the anomalous C7 roll drifts.

<p><br>
<strong><em>Loss of Fine Point</em></strong>
On 2016-02-01 16:40 UTC the spacecraft dropped out of fine point control. Observations continued in coarse point, with much degraded pointing performance, until 2016-02-02 22:27:26 UTC when the spacecraft reacquired fine point during a resat period. This resulted in 29:47:53 of coarse point data collection. These cadences are flagged as "spacecraft is not in fine point" using bit 16 in the data quality flags. The loss of fine point occured following a thruster firing fine tweak that resulted in the spacecraft rolling in the wrong direction. The next tweak was unable to correct the attitude before the loss of fine point fault was triggered, but fine pointing control was restored automatically at the next momentum wheel resaturation. There were several other instances of anomalous thruster firing tweaks in C8, none of which resulted in loss of fine point. Their cause is under investigation. </br></p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Light Curve Quality</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The dominant systematic present in K2 simple aperture photometry light curves is a sawtooth shape that is due to the roll of the spacecraft, which is corrected approximately every 6 hours. With the return to more nominal K2 roll performance in C8, we find CDPP values have improved noticeably over those from C7. Below, we examine observed noise levels in the PDC light curves for C8, Data Release 11.</p>
<p>Analysis of the light curve quality reveals that CDPP values are decreased by roughly 20% from C7, from 59.2 ppm in C7 to 47.0 ppm in C8, as measured by the tenth percentile of 12th magnitude dwarfs. The values are comparable to those from C4-C6. </p>
<p>The magnitude dependence of CDPP and its distribution over the focal plane are shown below. Other CDPP benchmarks can be found in the <a href="images/release-notes/c8/C8_bin1.00_sc1.00_CDPP_Summary_16052411.txt">table giving 6.5-hr CDPP as a function of magnitude.</a>

<p><strong><em>Poor Smear Correction</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Bright Stars</em></p>
<p>There are 2 channels in C8 for which the saturation spill due to very bright stars corrupts both the masked and virtual smear measurements for one or more columns. The affected channels are 23 (columns 500-507 and 1055-1059) and channel 45 (columns 162-166). In these cases, in order to allow the pipeline calibration to complete, we flag the masked smear as bad and process the data with only the virtual smear. As a result, the smear correction will be poor for the channel/column combinations listed above and will be suspect for the same columns on other outputs of the same module due to video crosstalk. </p>
<p>We identified 5 individual targets whose light curves are clearly affected by the poor smear correction: EPIC-220519545 and 220549392 (ch 23); EPIC-220530070 and 220539101 (ch 45), and EPIC-220566642 (ch 48). During this smear investigation, we identified one additional target, EPIC-220498268 on channel 65, that is within the saturation spill of a very bright star and has a similarly corrupted light curve.</p>
<p><em>Intermittent Streaks</em></p>
<p>There are episodic smear correction errors on channel 42 (mod.out 13.2), the channel containing the Uranus supermask. Nearly every long cadence in the supermask appears to contain between 2 and 20 columns which are brightened by 10 to 80 counts. The brightening of a column lasts only for a single cadence, with no obvious patterns as to which columns are affected in a given cadence. Two example cadences which are particularly affected are 119980 and 119982. </p>
<p>Preliminary investigation indicates that this streaking is caused by false cosmic ray detections in the smear collateral data. Because we do not see similar streaking in the supermask for IC 1613, located on channel 58, we believe that the poor cosmic ray detector performance is due to the bright signal from Uranus moving across columns and altering the cosmic ray detector's dynamic threshold. When false cosmic rays are removed from the smear signal, the pixel data in that column is under-corrected, resulting in a brightening of that column for a given cadence. The streaks are not in the raw data, so users may wish to do their own smear correction on this channel.</p>
<p>The extent of the problem in time and CCD columns can be seen in the figure <em>C8-Channel 42 Calibrated Smear</em>. The long cadence data were calibrated in three segments of ~1284 cadences each. The false cosmic ray detections are present in columns where Uranus appeared at any time during the set of cadences being processed. In the figure, the false detections are seen to be confined primarily to the first segment (relative cadence 1-1285, LC number 119907-121191) and third segment (relative cadence 2570-3853, LC number 122476-123759) and to columns above 500. Targets on channel 42 below column 500 should be relatively unaffected by this anomaly. </p>

<strong><em>Pluto</em></strong></br></p>
<p>Pluto, one of the largest trans-Neptunian objects, previously known as the ninth planet in our solar system, was observed during Campaign 7. The path of Pluto was tiled with 1 x n pixel target definitions, where n ranges from 1 to 217. The range of custom aperture numbers for Pluto is 200062954 -- 200062827. The animated gif below shows Pluto as observed by K2.

<strong><em>Ruprecht 47</em></strong></br></p>
<p>Ruprecht 47 is an open cluster observed with K2 during Campaign 7.  It was observed using a super-aperture, tiled with 60 51 x 51 masks, totalling 156,060 pixels. The custom aperture numbers range from 200062524 -- 200062583. </p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Increase in Roll Drift</em></strong></br></p>
<p>For C7, an alternate low-gain antenna was active during science data collection. The previously used LGA1 was replaced by LGA2 (see <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/KSCI-19033-001.pdf">KIH Figure 2</a>), as the latter is slightly better oriented with respect to earth. (This partially compensates for the increasing distance to the spacecraft in its earth-trailing orbit, now at 0.8 AU.)  Since the two antennas are mounted on opposite sides of the spacecraft, this antenna swap produced a change in radiation pressure that placed an additional (unbalanced) torque about the boresight on the spacecraft.  The resulting increase in roll drift is illustrated in Figure C7-RollDrift, which compares the drift rates for C4, C6, and C7. Consequently, the maximum excursion of any pixel from its nominal position is significantly larger for C7 than for previous campaigns (see Figure C7-MAR). </p>

<p>Given this unanticipated result, LGA1 will be used for C8, C9, and C10, while the fields of view for C11, C12, and C13 were tweaked by 0.12° – 0.16° (<a href="/minor-changes-in-the-fields-of-campaigns-11-12-and-13.html">see GO blog</a>) so that a subsequent return to LGA2 should have no adverse effects on data quality.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Effect of Roll on Photometry</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The unusually large roll motion in C7, combined with an extremely crowded field, had a strong impact on photometry, particularly on targets near the edge of the focal plane. This impact has several components: 
<ul>
<li>
In some cases target stars came close to the edge of their aperture masks. In such cases the photometric precision will be low. 
</li>
<li>
Background estimates based on background polynomials were strongly polluted by stars rolling in and out of the background apertures. This is especially true for channels near the edge of the focal plane (more roll) and near the Galactic plane (more stars). As a result, the background is strongly over-corrected, with short-time background variations strongly correlated with roll motion. These background variations have been subtracted from all pixels on the channel. 
</li>
<li>
The peaks of the roll motion in the background pixels were often incorrectly identified as cosmic rays and removed. The resulting change in background is minor in magnitude, but potentially diminishes the correlation between background variations and roll motion. 
</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The motion polynomials generally did a reasonable job tracking the large roll motion, and this enabled the computation of photometric apertures that significantly reduced the impact of roll motion in many cases. In other cases, however, the roll motion was too large for the recovery of high-quality photometry using the standard pipeline processing. </p>
<p>In addition to the issues with unusually large roll and crowding, stars selected for observation were unusually distributed in C7, with some channels having many targets and other channels having relatively few targets. The result was that some channels had few target stars in the range of magnitudes used to characterize field motion via motion polynomials. A particularly dramatic example is channel 24.4, where all the targets used to create the motion polynomial for this channel are in one corner, resulting in a very inaccurate motion polynomial. Because motion polynomials are used in the creation of the photometric aperture, photometry for some targets on 24.4 may be particularly poor.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Light Curve Quality</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The dominant systematic present in K2 simple aperture photometry light curves is a sawtooth shape that is due to the roll of the spacecraft approximately every 6 hours. The PDC module of the Kepler Pipeline uses Principle Component Analysis to remove this signal in addition to other systematics. Below, we examine observed noise levels in the PDC light curves for C7, Data Release 9.</p>
<p>Since two halos were used for targets near the center of the focal plane and three halos were used for targets around the periphery, the requisite pixels were captured, but the increased roll motion has severely challenged the data processing pipeline’s ability to perform high-precision photometry. Analysis of the light curve quality reveals that CDPP values are increased by roughly 35% above the benchmark value (tenth percentile of 12th magnitude dwarfs) compared to C4-C6. </p>

<strong><em>Poor Smear Correction</em></strong></br></p>
<p>There are 4 channels in C7 for which the saturation spill due to very bright stars spans all CCD rows for one or more columns, corrupting both the masked and virtual smear measurements for these columns. In these cases, in order to allow the pipeline calibration to complete, we flag the masked smear as bad and process the data with only the virtual smear. As a result, the smear correction will be poor for the channel/column combinations listed below and will be suspect for the same columns on other outputs on the same module as the indicated channel due to video crosstalk.</p>

<strong><em>Spica</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The star Spica (α Virginis, <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php?id=212573842&amp;action=Search">EPIC 212573842</a>) the 15th brightest star in the sky, is on silcon during Campaign 6. As can be seen on the FFI below, Spica is on mod.out 18.3 (channel 63) and its Schmidt-corrector reflection lies on mod.out 8.3. The star bleeds into both smear regions, preventing proper smear correction on columns 805-816 on channel 63.  Also, because of cross-talk, the Spica signal appears on all channels of module 18 at the same row and column position, but to a lesser degree.  For more information on cross-talk, see the <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/KSCI-19033-001.pdf">Instrument Handbook</a>. </p>

<strong><em>Variable Guide Star</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The star on Module 25 used for guiding during C6 was highly variable. No adverse effects of this variability were detected in the data collection or spacecraft operations.  </p>
<p><strong><em>*Update -- February 18, 2016</em></strong>*
<p> The signal seen in the guide star on module 25 appears to be that of a contact binary with a period of 14.5 hours and a depth of approximately 40 percent. A signal with the same period and phase is seen in a large number of long cadence, PDC, light curves with an amplitude as large as 0.1 per cent.  See the folded light curve, and normalized BLS spectra below.  The mechanism by which this signal is propagating into the K2 data is still under investigation.</p>
<p>To help users understand and mitigate the effects of this guide star, we make available the <a href="images/release-notes/c6/C6fgsFlux-mod25.csv"> module 25 guide star fluxes </a> in a csv file.  The guide star was selected from the USNO catalog and has an RA of 200.6867 degrees, Dec of -6.0353 degrees, and R magnitude of 9.51. </p>

<strong><em>Noted Data Anomalies</em></strong></br></p>
<p>Approximately 55.5 days after the start of C5, we note a small (~4000 electrons per cadence) increase in the median dark level that lasts approximately a day. The event is likely caused by a Coronal Mass Ejection, and its size is small compared to other normal variations seen in the dark level. This change in dark level is part of the normal calibration process that occurs in the CAL module.</p>
<p>One Argabrightening event was seen in the observed background level approximately 38 days into the campaign and affects a majority of the channels. This event is flagged on bit 13 in the QUALITY column of the light curve and target pixel files for those targets on the affected channels.</p>

<h2>Features and events</h2>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Pleiades and Hyades</em></strong></br></p>
<p>One Director's Discretionary Target program (GO4901, PI:White) was approved in Campaign 4 which observes the nine 3–5 mag B-stars and red giants in the Pleiades and Hyades open clusters. The targets were observed using circular pixel masks (20 pixels in radius) that cover the wings of the PSF but not the entire saturation bleed.</p>
<p>The two stars in the Hyades are γ Tau and δ1 Tau. The seven stars in the Pleiades are: Alcyone (η Tau), Atlas (27 Tau), Electra (17 Tau), Maia (20 Tau), Merope (23 Tau), Taygeta (19 Tau) and Pleione (28 Tau). These stars are all listed in the EPIC; however, their data are listed by custom aperture number at the MAST in the range 200007765--200007773.</p>
<div class="thumbnail" style="width: 68%;">

</div>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Trans-Neptunian Object</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The Trans-Neptunian Object 2002 KY14 was observed in Campaign 4 by creating 1340 masks that cover the path of the TNO. The custom aperture numbers range from 200006425 to 200007764. These observations were taken as part of Guest Observer program GO4110 (PI:Schwamb).</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Background Residuals near Pleiades</em></strong></br></p>
<p>Background removal for channels near the Pleiades has larger than normal residuals. These large residuals occur on mod.outs 10.3 and 15.1 through 15.4 due to the background on these channels being dominated by dust clouds near the Pleiades. The rich spatial structure of the Pleiades' dust clouds is poorly captured by the low order (≤ 4) polynomial model used to fit the background flux, with the best fit for these channels being given by a constant. This fit is done for every cadence, and the result is higher than normal background residuals, with residuals as large as 7 times the standard deviation of the background pixel values. (Normal residuals are typically less than the background standard deviation.)</p>
<p>We recommend caution when using light curves or the background model on these channels. Note that the FLUX column of the target pixel files contains calibrated pixels with the background subtracted. The amount of background that was subtracted per pixel can be found in the <a href="/K2/pipelineReleaseNotes.shtml#dr5">FLUX_BKG column</a> and restored, if desired.</p>
<p>Local background estimates per star may produce higher-quality results. The change in the constant background level on these channels over time is in family with the median background change on other channels</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Lightcurves Created with Non-Optimal Apertures</em></strong></br></p>
<p>Due to an incompatibility between K2 roll motion and the determination of photometric optimal apertures, some light curves may be based on apertures that are too small and therefore have more noise than necessary. In particular, there are 887 stellar targets that are particularly suspect; they are listed <a href="/K2/K2drn/C4/C4_reduced_ap_targets.txt">here</a>. The brighter targets in this set may have correct optimal apertures, but stars with Kp &gt; 13 have been shown to have lower photometric precision than non-suspect stars of similar brightness.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Stars Show Lower Than Expected Flux</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The comparison of the measured flux to the flux based on their Kepler magnitudes in the EPIC catalog shows that ≈3,752 stars (23.8% of all stellar targets) are too bright by about a magnitude. The EPIC catalog field Kepflag gives the provenance of the Kepler magnitude estimate by listing the catalog magnitudes used to estimate the Kepler magnitude. Stars with Kepflag = “JHK” or “J” have Kepler magnitudes that are generally overestimated. These stars appear at all magnitudes, but predominantly have EPIC Kepler magnitudes dimmer than 14. The optimal apertures used to generate light curves for these “JHK” or “J” targets may be larger than optimal, reducing their photometric precision.</p>
<div class="thumbnail" style="width: 100%;">
<div class="caption">
<i>Figure: histograms of the relative flux for C4 stellar targets. Left: the relative flux distribution of stellar targets with EPIC Kepflag values of “gri” or “BV”, showing that their measured flux is consistent with the expected flux. Right: the relative flux distribution of stellar targets with EPIC Kepflag values of “JHK” or “J”, showing that the observed flux is less than half the expected flux.</i>

</img></a>
</div>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Several Stars Show Higher Than Expected Flux</em></strong></br></p>
<p>There is a group of target stars whose measured flux is more than twice that expected from their EPIC Kepler magnitudes. The figure below shows that these stars fall into spatial groups that are aligned with RA and Dec, rather than focal plane coordinates, strongly indicating that the cause of this anomaly is catalog error. The source of this error is presently unknown and is not correlated with Kepflag values. The optimal apertures used to generate light curves for these targets may be smaller than optimal, reducing their photometric precision.</p>
<div class="thumbnail" style="width: 68%;">
<div class="caption">
<i>Figure: all C4 target stars plotted in celestial coordinates, colored by their Kepler magnitude inferred from their observed flux minus their Kepler magnitude from the EPIC catalog. There are two square-like regions and a line of blue markers, indicating stars whose inferred Kepler magnitude is about a magnitude smaller than their catalog magnitude, indicating that these stars are about a magnitude brighter than expected. The randomly distributed red markers are consistent with the population of Kepflag = “JHK” or “J” stars whose brightness is overestimated.</i>

<p><br>
<strong><em>Stellar Targets with Negative Lightcurve Values</em></strong></br></p>
<p>Seventy-six stellar targets show negative flux values in their SAP_FLUX light curves, which is somewhat more than normally seen. Most of these are very dim, near background level targets at the edge of the focal plane where K2 roll has the largest impact, so it is not surprising that the roll causes negative flux values after background removal. The bright targets with negative flux values either have isolated negative flux outliers or are on the Pleiades channels, where there are large background residuals due to the constant background model on these channels, see above.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Light Curve Quality</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The dominant systematic present in K2 simple aperture photometry light curves is a sawtooth shape that is due to the roll of the spacecraft approximately every 6 hours. The PDC module of the Kepler Pipeline uses Principle Component Analysis to remove this signal in addition to other systematics. Below, we examine observed trends and noise levels in the PDC light curves for C4, Data Release 6.</p>

<h2>Features and events</h2>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Neptune</em></strong></br></p>
<p>Neptune moved across the field of view during C3 and K2 observed it in both long and short cadence. Short cadence data were obtained approximately 20 days either side of the stationary point of Neptune. See this time lapse <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw-q3uM_5_0">movie</a> created by Jason Rowe that clearly shows Neptune and its moons, Titan and Nereid. The custom aperture numbers associated with Neptune are 200004468--200004923. These observations were taken as part of Guest Observer Programs GO3060 (PI:Rowe) and GO3057 (PI:Gaulme).</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Trans-Neptunian Object</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The Trans-Neptunian Object (225088) 2007 OR10 was observed with 2 masks and given custom aperture numbers 200004466 and 200004467. This target was observed as part of Guest Observer Program GO3053 (PI:Szabo).</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Highlights of Pipeline Improvements</em></strong></br></p>
<p>Campaign 3 (Data Release 5) data were the first K2 data processed with the SOC 9.3 pipeline. With this data release comes the higher-level data products. A detailed list of the pipeline developments that accompany this data release is listed on the <a href="/K2/pipelineReleaseNotes.shtml#dr5">pipeline release page</a>. A few highlights are listed here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality flags now indicate which cadences were obtained during thruster firings.</li>
<li>Background pixels were observerd and used to model the background level across the field of view. The calibrated pixels available in the target pixel files now have this background level removed.</li>
<li>Simple Aperture Photometry (SAP_FLUX) and cotrended (PDCSAP_FLUX) light curves are available for long cadence data.</li>
<li>The FFIs now contain a World Coordinate Solution.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Light Curve Quality</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The dominant systematic present in K2 simple aperture photometry light curves is a sawtooth shape that is due to the roll of the spacecraft approximately every 6 hours. The PDC module of the Kepler Pipeline uses Principle Component Analysis to remove this signal in addition to other systematics. Below, we examine observed trends and noise levels in the PDC light curves for C3 (as measured using Data Release 5).</p>

<p>The short cadence light curves produced by the Kepler pipeline are inadequate for scientific research and are not being released at this time.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Reduced Noise from Change in Bandwidth</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The change in bandwidth for pointing control (from 50 to 20 seconds) for C3 resulted in an increase in SNR for short cadence by a factor of roughly 4--9, with the larger improvement seen at the higher frequency end. Note, the bandwidth pointing control parameter was set to 10 seconds for the original Kepler Mission.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Premature End</em></strong></br></p>
<p>Campaign 3 had a nominal duration of 80 days, but an actual duration of only 69.2 days. The campaign ended earlier than expected because the on-board storage filled up faster than anticipated due to unusually poor data compression.</p>

<h2>Features and events</h2>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Solar Activity</em></strong></br></p>
<p>During C2 Kepler experienced two energetic particle events of note, likely caused by solar activity. Both events affected all channels as can be seen in the dark current metric plot for the first 26 days of C2 (see below). The first was a broad peak lasting approximately from cadence 95924 -- 96335 (01-Sep-2014 11:51:30 Z [MJD: 56901.4941] to 09-Sep-2014 21:24:55 Z [MJD: 56909.8923]). The second was a stronger more-peaked event lasting approximately from cadence 96357 -- 96551 (10-Sep-2014 17:01:54 Z [56910.7096] to 14-Sep-2014 07:20:35 Z [56914.30596]). At the peak of the 10-Sep-2014 event the average dark current increased by a factor of ~7 over the quiescent level. The GOES x-ray flux plot for this time shows an increased x-ray flux at Earth, though we don't have an independent measure of the exact timing and magnitude at the location of Kepler. The impact to the data will be in the form of increased background level, and increased photometric noise. The impact will be largest for faint targets.</p>

<strong><em>Mars</em></strong></br></p>
<p>Mars passed across the field of view between October 1 and October 23. See the figure below for a prediction of where Mars is on the focal plane during Campaign 2. Mars is a bright object which will saturate the CCD. Both its image and its reflection will likely contaminate nearby stars.</p>

<strong><em>LDE Flags</em></strong></br></p>
<p>During the latter half of C2 we experienced a large number of parity errors coming from the photometer's local detector electronics (LDE). These LDE parity errors can occur when a very bright star saturates and spills charge into the CCD serial readout register, causing an overflow at the input to the analog-to-digital converter. While these errors were rare in Kepler, the very bright stars, or solar system planets, on the focal plane in K2 can cause frequent parity errors. For example, stars on channels 67 and 75 were the source of many of the parity errors during C2. These errors do not affect the quality of data from pixels on the active focal plane.</p>
<p>The LDE parity error triggers a flag (bit 15, decimal=16384) in the QUALITY column of the target pixel files. This flag is set for the majority of cadences in the second half of the campaign.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Attitude Tweak</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The pointing of the spacecraft was adjusted by approximately 10" on 2014-Aug-25, during cadence 95546, in order to ensure that the observed targets were centered in their masks. This event is flagged in the QUALITY column of the target pixel files with bit 1 (decimal=1). The data collected before the tweak may fall close to the edge of the collected mask and some of the object's flux may have been lost. Use these cadences with caution. 
Note, in Data Release 4, because of an operator error, the tweak is marked on the previous cadence, 95545.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Two Globular Clusters</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The clusters M4 and M80 were observed in C2 by collecting all the pixels in 50x50 pixel masks. For M4, 16 of these custom apertures were collected and for M80, 4 were collected. The data files for M4 range from 200004370 -- 200004385. The data files for M80 range from 200004386 -- 200004389. The target pixel files may be found by using the Object Type field on the <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/data_search/search.php">MAST K2 data search</a> page.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Two Solar System Objects</em></strong></br></p>
<p>Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) was observed by obtaining 2583, 25x1 pixel, masks across module.outputs 2.3, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4. These apertures were given custom aperture numbers ranging from 200001787 -- 200004369. This target was observed as part of the Guest Observer Programs GO2030 (PI:Kelley) and GO2046 (PI:Lisse).</p>
<p>The Trans-Neptunian Object (268361) 2007 JJ43 was observed with 661, 11x1 or 13x1 pixel, masks and given custom aperture numbers ranging from 200001126 -- 200001786. This target was observed as part of Guest Observer Program GO2066 (PI:Schwamb).</p>
<p>These data sets can be found at the <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/data_search/search.php">MAST</a> by entering the Investigation ID on the search form. The Investigation ID matches the GO Program number that requested the observations.</p>

<strong><em>EPIC Catalog Assignment</em></strong></br></p>
<p>For C2, a number of targets were proposed without <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic.pdf">EPIC</a> ID numbers. If a target was observed, it was either 1) given an EPIC ID number from the regular catalog if that target matched a target in the catalog, or 2) assigned a new EPIC ID. We created EPIC ID numbers for 69 targets, ranging from 210282492 -- 210282560.</p>

<h2>Features and events</h2>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Attitude Tweak</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The attitude of the spacecraft was changed by a few pixels at cadence 91433 to better position the targets in the center of their apertures. All cadences in C1 prior to this event have the first bit in the QUALITY column set (integer value = 1) to indicate that they were taken prior to the tweak.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Trans-Neptunian Object</em></strong></br></p>
<p>A long-cadence custom aperture was constructed in order to collect data on trans-Neptunian Object 2002 GV31. Note, this target is very faint (V=22) and falls in its custom aperture pixels for only about 10 days. This custom aperture can be found by searching the MAST for the K2 ID numbered 200001049.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>EPIC Catalog Assignment</em></strong></br></p>
<p>For this Campaign, a number of targets were proposed without EPIC ID numbers. If a target was observed, it was either 1) given an EPIC ID number from the regular catalog if that target matched a target in the catalog, or 2) assigned a new EPIC ID. We created EPIC ID numbers for 28 targets, ranging from 210282464 to 210282491. Regular EPIC targets in C1 have catalog ID numbers ranging from 201000001 to 202059065.</p>

<h2>Features and events</h2>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Not In Fine Point Data</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The second half of the C0 data is more indicative of the quality of data users should expect from K2. The Kepler spacecraft was not in fine point for the first part of C0, causing large photometric scatter. The data quality is much improved in the second half of the campaign, beginning on cadence 89347 after the safe mode, when compared to the first half of the campaign. See the QUALITY flag (bit 16) to determine when the spacecraft was in fine point.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Safe Mode</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The Kepler Spacecraft was in safe mode between cadences 88198 and 89346. Data is flagged in the QUALITY column with bit 2. The project used this time to fix large attitude errors that were occuring during resaturation events.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Photometric Jitter Caused by Lower Bandwidth</em></strong></br></p>
<p>During the development of the K2 Mission, the number of guide stars per fine-guidance sensor (FGS) was changed from ten (for Kepler) to one (for K2). This change was demanded by the need for increased aperture sizes given the uncertainties in the star-tracker to boresight alignment and the need to acquire an entirely new field-of-view every 80 to 90 days. To compensate for the increased sensor noise and assure that fine-point lock could be achieved, the attitude control bandwidth was decreased from 0.1 Hz (for Kepler) to 0.02 Hz (for K2). This change in bandwidth means that the cross-boresight attitude (i.e., RA and Dec) has a time constant of 50 seconds, comparable to the short-cadence duration. Engineering studies have shown that the photometric precision of the long-cadence data is also compromised by the larger pointing jitter associated with the lower bandwidth. The project has approved a change in bandwidth to 0.05 Hz (20 seconds) starting with Campaign 3.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Large Pixel Masks</em></strong></br></p>
<p>When planning C0 observations, the pointing performance of K2 was not accurately known. The worst case scenario was that a star at the edge of the focal plane could move as much as 40" from its nominal position. Therefore each star was assigned a large pixel mask by first computing a Kepler-style optimal aperture and then adding 10 rings of pixels to account for a potential 40" pointing offset. During the second half of C0, the pointing performance was excellent and the pointing drifts were no more than 6" for any target star. Care will be needed when performing photometry on C0 data. Simply including all collected pixels for a given target will not create a high signal-to-noise light curve. For tools to help choose your photometric aperture, see for example, <a href="http://keplergo.arc.nasa.gov/PyKE.shtml">PyKE contributed software</a>.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Jupiter's Reflection</em></strong></br></p>
<p>Because K2 points along the ecliptic, its field of view will occasionally contain bright solar system objects. Jupiter was in the K2 field of view during C0 from 2014-03-14 through 2014-05-12, but fell on dead module 3. It creates a bright antipodal ghost on module 23, channel 79, and impacts all the targets observed in this region. See the FFI ktwo2014074233223-c00, extension 79, for an image of the reflection.</p>
<p>While Jupiter was on the focal plane, the background level was increased over its nominal value for nearly half the channels, with the largest impact seen in channels 53 -- 84. In addition, as Jupiter moved on and off the focal plane, a specular reflection lasting approximately 6 hours was seen in these channels. The relative background levels as measured in the smear signal from channel 83 are shown below as Jupiter enters the focal plane (near cadence no. 87525) and leaves the focal plane (cadence no. 90375). The specular bump resulted in an increase in background level of 25-30% for the affected channels, while the quasi-static background increase for the time Jupiter was on the focal plane was 3-5%.</p>

<strong><em>Observations of M35 and NGC 2158</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The open clusters M35 (NGC 2168) and NGC 2158 were observed during this campaign by placing 154 separate 50x50 pixel masks over the densest portion of these two adjacent clusters. Each mask was given a custom aperture number to act as the unique identifier found in the file name. The target pixel files for these clusters have custom aperture numbers ranging from 200,000,811 to 200,000,964.</p>

<p><br>
<strong><em>Channel 10 Black Correction</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The black correction on Channel 10, mod.out 4.2, has problems because a bright star bleeds into the black region. For data release 1, the affected regions of the black are excluded from the fit of the black, so the fit is poorly constrained and we see chatter in the residuals. This mostly affects stars in the last 200 rows of the channel.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Image Artifacts in K2</em></strong></br></p>
<p>The thermal environment is changing more rapidly in K2 than it did for the Kepler Mission. As a result the number of channels with significant rolling band (changes in the black level that are both time and spatial dependent) is larger for K2. The channels observed to be most impacted by rolling band in C0 are 1, 2, 10, 11, 14, 25-28, 36, 44, 58, 62, 74 and 79. Other known image artifacts, such as Moiré patterns and undershoot from bright stars, are also likely to be enhanced in K2 data as compared to Kepler. See the <a href="http://archtest.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/KSCI-19033-001.pdf">Kepler Instrument Handbook</a>.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Module 7 Failure</em></strong></br></p>
<p>Prior to the start of C0, on January 21, 2014, the photometer was autonomously powered off by an under voltage fault in the Local Detector Electronics Power Supply. Since that time, module 7 (i.e., channels 17 to 20) has yielded no star data or charge injection signal. The subsequent behavior of this module is very similar to that of module 3 after it failed on January 19, 2010. K2 continues to operate and collect simultaneous data from sources falling upon the remaining 19 detector modules over 105 square degrees. There is no indication of any accelerated degradation on these other modules.</p>
<p><br>
<strong><em>Cropped Calibrated Pixels in Data Release 1</em></strong></br></p>
<p><strong>The problem described below was corrected in Data Release 2 of the Campaign 0 data. See the DATA_REL keyword in the primary header of the target pixel file to determine which data release you have. We recommend that everyone use the latest release of the data.</strong></p>
<p>In Data Release 1, for cadences after the Safe Mode (cadence no. 89346), the calibrated data (see the FLUX column in the exported target pixel files) is incorrectly reporting a value of zero for pixels collected near the edge of the aperture. The raw pixels (see the RAW_CNTS column) do not have this issue, so the collected data is properly reported in the target pixel files. An example of the issue is shown in the figure below. The left image is the mask (white indicates a collected pixel), the central image shows the calibrated pixels and the right image contains the raw pixels for one cadence. Those columns and rows that are black in the central image incorrectly have a value of zero, but there is clearly data in the original raw data on the right.</p>
<p>This issue occurs for both the long and short cadence data. It does not appear in the custom apertures, so the calibrated pixels are being exported as expected for these files.</p>
