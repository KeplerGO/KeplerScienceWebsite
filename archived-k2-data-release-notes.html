<h2>Features and Events</h2>
<p><strong><em>Clusters and Star Forming Regions</em></strong></p>
<p>The C13 field of view encompasses part of the Taurus star forming region,
including the well
known T-Tauri stars HL Tau (EPIC 210690913) and LkCa 15 (EPIC 247520207).
The field of view also covers a portion of the
Hyades star cluster along with the distant clusters
NGC 1647, NGC 1746, and NGC 1817.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Galaxies</em></strong></p>
<p>There are 33 galaxies targeted in the C13 field of view.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Pointing and Roll Performance</em></strong></p>
<p>The C13 pointing and roll behavior are within the limits of that seen
in other K2 campaigns for the majority of the campaign.
The pipeline calculated maximum distance between the
derived and nominal positions for any target (the "maximum attitude residual", or MAR)
for C13 is well under the 3-pixel limit accommodated by the aperture halos,
except for three periods with anomalous thruster firings. One is in the first day
of the campaign lasting for 6 hours starting at 2017-03-08 17:46:06 UTC
(cadence numbers 140911-140922).
Two periods of anomalous pointing occur in the final five days
of the campaign: 18 hours starting at 2017-05-23 12:11:44 UTC
(cadence numbers 144619-144654), and 6 hours
starting at 2017-05-25 11:16:28 UTC (cadence numbers 144715-144726).
These anomalous thruster firing events occurring near the start and end of campaigns
are suspected to be due to low fuel levels. The flight team is investigating them in
an effort to understand whether they can be mitigated and how they might
evolve in future campaigns.</p>

<p><strong><em>Smear Correction Error on Channel 74</em></strong></p>
<p>The presence of the first magnitude star Aldebaran on channel 73 led to an error in
the smear correction for channel 74, which shares the same physical CCD (see figure
Aldebaran).
The saturated charge from Aldebaran spills over all rows of the image and into the
serial register of the CCD, corrupting the first three rows of the masked smear region
in the FFI. While these rows are not used for the smear correction, at times during
C13 the saturation spill covered more rows in the masked smear, extending up to row 15 on
channel 74 (see figure Channel 74 Trailing Black). Trailing black rows 7-18 are fit
with a linear model to estimate the black (bias) level for the masked smear region.</p>
<p>At these times,
the trailing black estimate for the masked smear signal was corrupted, resulting in a
corrupted smear measurement for the affected cadences. Since the smear signal is subtracted
from all the pixels in the channel, all targets on channel 74 were affected for these
cadences. The impact is somewhat mitigated by background correction, but due to the
non-linearity correction during calibration, a residual error remains. The effect is
generally more significant for faint targets; however, users are cautioned
to estimate the impact on their science of using data from the affected cadences.
In addition, due to the rapidly changing background estimate, the argabrightening
detector (see <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/Data_Characteristics.pdf">Kepler Data Characteristics Handbook, Sec 5.8</a>)
was triggered on channel 74 resulting in data gaps in the light curve files for
some targets. Users should treat the channel specific argabrightening indicator
in QUALITY and SAP_QUALITY flags with caution
(bit 13, decimal=4096).</p>
<p>The smear corruption effects were most prominent in the
first 80 cadences of the campaign and again in the period between cadence 1800-3200
(see Figure Channel 74 Trailing Black)
In order to allow users to select the cadences they wish to exclude, the attached
csv file <a href="images/release-notes/c13/c13_ch74_black_for_smear_residuals.csv">c13_ch74_black_for_smear_residuals.csv</a>
contains the residual black level for the masked smear pixels after model fitting for
each LC.
The units of the residual signal are ADU/LC/pixel. The cadences with large negative
residuals (&lt;-200 ADU/LC/pixel) and those showing bimodal behavior are indicative of
a poor model fit and a corrupted smear correction.</p>

<h2>Data Quality and Processing Notes</h2>
<p><strong><em>Light Curve Quality</em></strong></p>
<p>As in previous campaigns, the 6-hour spacecraft roll cycle continues
to dominate the systematic
errors in C13 simple aperture photometry light curves.
Similar to C12, the pipeline CDPP 12th magnitude noise
benchmark is 15-20% higher than what was seen in star fields of comparable star
density (e.g. C4, C5). There is tentative evidence that at least part of this increase
is due to the anomalous pointing excursions at the beginning and end of the campaign.
In future campaigns, the processing will exclude such cadences from PDC and from
the CDPP estimates.</p>
<p>The magnitude dependence of CDPP and its distribution over the focal
plane are shown below. Other CDPP benchmarks can be found in the
<a href="images/release-notes/c13/c13_bin1.00_sc1.00_CDPP_Summary_17080715.txt">

<p>
Campaign 11 was operationally separated into two segments as a result of an
error in the initial roll-angle used to minimize solar torque on the spacecraft.
The larger than expected roll motion seen at the start of the campaign meant
that the targets would be rolling out of their pixel apertures by the end of the
campaign. The excess roll motion was corrected twenty-three days into the campaign
by applying a -0.32º roll offset. The size of this correction meant
that new target aperture definitions
had to be used for the second part of the campaign.
The two segments are identified in the
archive products as C111 and C112, respectively.

<h2>Features and Events</h2>
<p><strong><em>Galactic Bulge</em></strong></p>
<p>The C11 field of view is the densest star field for which pipeline light curves have been created.
The average density of stars with magnitude 11.5 &lt; Kp &lt; 14.5 over the field of view is
6959 stars/deg^2. Detector channels covering the galactic bulge have densities as high
as 25,000 stars/deg^2. For comparison the average density of stars in this magnitude range
for the Kepler field of view is 900 stars/deg^2. As a result of the high star density, many
of the pipeline algorithms are operating outside of their design range. Users are cautioned
to treat the pipeline background, centroid, and aperture photometry results with care, especially
on channels covering the Galactic Bulge.
<div class="thumbnail">
<div class="caption">

<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Saturn</em></strong></p>
<p>Saturn (V = +1) and its bright moons Titan (V = +9), and Enceladus (V = +12) entered
channel 84 near the end of the campaign (Dec 3, ~12h UT) allowing ~4.5 days of observations.
Titan is ~18 pixels away from Saturn, while Enceladus is only 2-4 pixels from Saturn and
regularly passed through Saturn's saturated charge spill columns. Both Titan and Enceladus
were tiled with custom aperture masks.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Attitude Offset and Segmenting of C11 Data</em></strong></p>
<p>The spacecraft attitude was adjusted by -0.32º in roll on 2016-10-21 to correct
the initial roll-offset error. Because this attitude offset was large enough to
require new target pixel apertures, the C11 data were processed through the
pipeline in two separate parts:
<ul>
<li>the first 23 days of data, dubbed C11a<br>
<li>the remaining 48 days of the campaign, dubbed C11b.
</li></br></li></ul>
The C11a files are found in the archive under Campaign number 111. The C11b
files have Campaign number 112. A search for Campaign 11 will return both sets of files.
Users should take care when combining data from C11a and C11b for targets. Because the
targets have changed pixels -and in some cases detectors- there is no guarantee that the
C11a and C11b fluxes will match in absolute value, or even slope across the C11a-C11b boundary.
The C11a and C11b data may need to be treated as coming from two separate campaigns.
The figures below give some examples of the behavior of SAP flux over C11.</p>
<p>In some cases, the updated C11b target apertures extended off the edge of the active
CCD and included rows of collateral smear, or columns of collateral black data. These
collateral data are evident in the TPFs and should not be used when doing photometry on
the target.
<div class="caption">

<p><strong><em>Pointing and Roll Performance</em></strong></p>
<p>The C11a and C11b pointing and
roll behavior are within the limits of that seen in other K2 campaigns.
The pipeline calculated maximum distance between the
derived and nominal positions for any target (the "maximum attitude residual", or MAR)
for C11 is well under the 3-pixel limit accommodated by the aperture halos.<br>
The C11a attitude error started at a relatively high value and large roll amplitude,
due in part to the initial roll offset error. The negative going roll offsets
along with the large negative roll rate at the start of C11a indicated that,
without correction, the roll would have been unacceptably large in the 6-hours
between thruster firing windows by the end of the campaign. The large roll would have
caused targets at the edge of the focal plane to roll out of their apertures.
The roll offset was corrected during the gap starting
around 2016-10-16 seen in the C11-Pointing History figure, resulting in a roll profile
for C11b that is more typical of past campaigns.
Similarly, the C11a maximum attitude residual was
somewhat high -though well within the aperture limits- while the C11b
starting maximum attitude
residual was more typical of K2 behavior.</br></p>
<p>There was a smaller related change in roll behavior during C11a when the spacecraft
X-band communications were switched from low gain antenna 2(LGA-2) to LGA-1. The
antenna switch resulted in different thermal torque on the spacecraft and somewhat
mitigated the initial C11a roll pointing error. The improvement is most evident in the
roll rate at a solar elongation angle of -35º (top right panel below), but can be
seen in the roll error at around 2016-10-02 (top left panel below).</p>

<h2>Data Quality and Processing Notes</h2>
<p><strong><em>Light Curve Quality</em></strong></p>
<p>We consider the C11a and C11b pipeline-generated light curves separately
for noise analysis and comparison with previous campaigns.
As in previous campaigns, the 6-hour spacecraft roll cycle
continues to dominate the systematic
errors in C11 simple aperture photometry light curves.</p>
<p>The magnitude dependence of CDPP and its distribution over the focal plane
are shown below. Other CDPP benchmarks can be found in the

<p><strong><em>Targets Missing from the Archive</em></strong></p>
<p>Pipeline errors during the process of exporting the light curve (LCV) and
target pixel (TP) FITS files resulted in targets from both C11a and C11b
having no LCV or TP files at the archive.
There are <a href="images/release-notes/c11/c11a_missing_export_target_epic_ids.txt">194
missing targets for C11a</a> (15 are non-custom targets) and
<a href="images/release-notes/c11/c11b_missing_export_target_epic_ids.txt">3
missing custom-aperture targets for C11b</a>. There is no overlap between the C11a
and C11b missing target lists. The project is investigating options
for delivering these targets in the future.
<br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Poor Smear Correction - Bright Stars</em></strong></p>
<p>There were several very bright stars observed in C11 with saturation spilling
over all rows of the array on <em>three</em> channels, corrupting the smear measurement
for the affected columns. For these columns
the virtual smear measurement is used for smear correction,
though it is known that this value is invalid and will corrupt data on the
affected columns. Given the normal motion of the stars in K2 due to roll and
differential velocity aberration, it is likely
that adjacent columns will be corrupted at some times during the campaign. The
smear corruption is complicated in C11 due to the roll offset: stars at the edge
of the array moved up to 30 pixels from C11a to C11b, while stars in the center
modules moved only slightly. The channels and affected columns in C11a and C11b
are given below.</p>

<p><strong><em>LDE Flags</em></strong></p>
<p>During the last three days of C11b we experienced a large number of parity errors coming from the photometer's local detector electronics (LDE). These LDE parity errors can occur when a very bright object saturates and spills charge into the CCD serial readout register, causing an overflow at the input to the analog-to-digital converter. The LDE parity errors were likely caused by the image of Saturn on the focal plane. These errors do not affect the quality of data from pixels on the active focal plane.</p>
<p>The LDE parity error triggers a flag (bit 15, decimal=16384) in the QUALITY column of the target pixel files. Most of the cadences from long cadence number 136276 (2016-12-4 00:58 UTC) to LC 136426 (2016-12-7 02:32 UTC) have the parity error flag set.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Noted Data Anomalies</em></strong></p>
<p>Approximately 55.5 days after the start of C5, we note a small (~4000 electrons per cadence) increase in the median dark level that lasts approximately a day. The event is likely caused by a Coronal Mass Ejection, and its size is small compared to other normal variations seen in the dark level. This change in dark level is part of the normal calibration process that occurs in the CAL module.</p>
<p>One Argabrightening event was seen in the observed background level approximately 38 days into the campaign and affects a majority of the channels. This event is flagged on bit 13 in the QUALITY column of the light curve and target pixel files for those targets on the affected channels.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Data Quality and Processing Notes</h2>
<p><strong><em>Light Curve Quality</em></strong></p>
<p>The dominant systematic present in K2 simple aperture photometry light curves is a sawtooth shape that is due to the roll of the spacecraft approximately every 6 hours.

<h2>Features and Events</h2>
<p><strong><em>Neptune</em></strong></p>
<p>Neptune moved across the field of view during C3 and K2 observed it in both long and short cadence. Short cadence data were obtained approximately 20 days either side of the stationary point of Neptune. See this time lapse <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw-q3uM_5_0">movie</a> created by Jason Rowe that clearly shows Neptune and its moons, Triton and Nereid. The custom aperture numbers associated with Neptune are 200004468--200004923. These observations were taken as part of Guest Observer Programs GO3060 (PI:Rowe) and GO3057 (PI:Gaulme).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Trans-Neptunian Object</em></strong></p>
<p>The Trans-Neptunian Object (225088) 2007 OR10 was observed with 2 masks and given custom aperture numbers 200004466 and 200004467. This target was observed as part of Guest Observer Program GO3053 (PI:Szabo).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Premature End</em></strong></p>
<p>Campaign 3 had a nominal duration of 80 days, but an actual duration of only 69.2 days. The campaign ended earlier than expected because the on-board storage filled up faster than anticipated due to unusually poor data compression.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Data Quality and Processing Notes</h2>
<p><strong><em>Highlights of Pipeline Improvements</em></strong></p>
<p>Campaign 3 (Data Release 5) data were the first K2 data processed with the SOC 9.3 pipeline. With this data release comes the higher-level data products. A detailed list of the pipeline developments that accompany this data release is listed on the <a href="k2-pipeline-release-notes.html#data-release-5">pipeline release page</a>. A few highlights are listed here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality flags now indicate which cadences were obtained during thruster firings.</li>
<li>Background pixels were observerd and used to model the background level across the field of view. The calibrated pixels available in the target pixel files now have this background level removed.</li>
<li>Simple Aperture Photometry (SAP_FLUX) and cotrended (PDCSAP_FLUX) light curves are available for long cadence data.</li>
<li>The FFIs now contain a World Coordinate Solution.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Light Curve Quality</em></strong></p>
<p>The dominant systematic present in K2 simple aperture photometry light curves is a sawtooth shape that is due to the roll of the spacecraft approximately every 6 hours. The PDC module of the Kepler Pipeline uses Principle Component Analysis to remove this signal in addition to other systematics. Below, we examine observed trends and noise levels in the PDC light curves for C3 (as measured using Data Release 5).</p>

<p>The short cadence light curves produced by the Kepler pipeline are inadequate for scientific research and are not being released at this time.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Reduced Noise from Change in Bandwidth</em></strong></p>
<p>The change in bandwidth for pointing control (from 50 to 20 seconds) for C3 resulted in an increase in SNR for short cadence by a factor of roughly 4--9, with the larger improvement seen at the higher frequency end. Note, the bandwidth pointing control parameter was set to 10 seconds for the original Kepler Mission.</p>

<h2>Features and events</h2>
<p><br/>
<strong><em>Solar Activity</em></strong></p>
<p>During C2 Kepler experienced two energetic particle events of note, likely caused by solar activity. Both events affected all channels as can be seen in the dark current metric plot for the first 26 days of C2 (see below). The first was a broad peak lasting approximately from cadence 95924 -- 96335 (01-Sep-2014 11:51:30 Z [MJD: 56901.4941] to 09-Sep-2014 21:24:55 Z [MJD: 56909.8923]). The second was a stronger more-peaked event lasting approximately from cadence 96357 -- 96551 (10-Sep-2014 17:01:54 Z [56910.7096] to 14-Sep-2014 07:20:35 Z [56914.30596]). At the peak of the 10-Sep-2014 event the average dark current increased by a factor of ~7 over the quiescent level. The GOES x-ray flux plot for this time shows an increased x-ray flux at Earth, though we don't have an independent measure of the exact timing and magnitude at the location of Kepler. The impact to the data will be in the form of increased background level, and increased photometric noise. The impact will be largest for faint targets.</p>

<strong><em>Mars</em></strong></p>
<p>Mars passed across the field of view between October 1 and October 23. See the figure below for a prediction of where Mars is on the focal plane during Campaign 2. Mars is a bright object which will saturate the CCD. Both its image and its reflection will likely contaminate nearby stars.</p>

</a>
</div>
<p><br/>
<strong><em>LDE Flags</em></strong></p>
<p>During the latter half of C2 we experienced a large number of parity errors coming from the photometer's local detector electronics (LDE). These LDE parity errors can occur when a very bright star saturates and spills charge into the CCD serial readout register, causing an overflow at the input to the analog-to-digital converter. While these errors were rare in Kepler, the very bright stars, or solar system planets, on the focal plane in K2 can cause frequent parity errors. For example, stars on channels 67 and 75 were the source of many of the parity errors during C2. These errors do not affect the quality of data from pixels on the active focal plane.</p>
<p>The LDE parity error triggers a flag (bit 15, decimal=16384) in the QUALITY column of the target pixel files. This flag is set for the majority of cadences in the second half of the campaign.</p>
<p><br/>
<strong><em>Attitude Tweak</em></strong></p>
<p>The pointing of the spacecraft was adjusted by approximately 10" on 2014-Aug-25, during cadence 95546, in order to ensure that the observed targets were centered in their masks. This event is flagged in the QUALITY column of the target pixel files with bit 1 (decimal=1). The data collected before the tweak may fall close to the edge of the collected mask and some of the object's flux may have been lost. Use these cadences with caution.
Note, in Data Release 4, because of an operator error, the tweak is marked on the previous cadence, 95545.</p>
<p><br/>
<strong><em>Two Globular Clusters</em></strong></p>
<p>The clusters M4 and M80 were observed in C2 by collecting all the pixels in 50x50 pixel masks. For M4, 16 of these custom apertures were collected and for M80, 4 were collected. The data files for M4 range from 200004370 -- 200004385. The data files for M80 range from 200004386 -- 200004389. The target pixel files may be found by using the Object Type field on the <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/data_search/search.php">MAST K2 data search</a> page.</p>
<p><br/>
<strong><em>Two Solar System Objects</em></strong></p>
<p>Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring) was observed by obtaining 2583, 25x1 pixel, masks across module.outputs 2.3, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4. These apertures were given custom aperture numbers ranging from 200001787 -- 200004369. This target was observed as part of the Guest Observer Programs GO2030 (PI:Kelley) and GO2046 (PI:Lisse).</p>
<p>The Trans-Neptunian Object (268361) 2007 JJ43 was observed with 661, 11x1 or 13x1 pixel, masks and given custom aperture numbers ranging from 200001126 -- 200001786. This target was observed as part of Guest Observer Program GO2066 (PI:Schwamb).</p>
<p>These data sets can be found at the <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/data_search/search.php">MAST</a> by entering the Investigation ID on the search form. The Investigation ID matches the GO Program number that requested the observations.</p>

<strong><em>EPIC Catalog Assignment</em></strong></p>
<p>For C2, a number of targets were proposed without <a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic.pdf">EPIC</a> ID numbers. If a target was observed, it was either 1) given an EPIC ID number from the regular catalog if that target matched a target in the catalog, or 2) assigned a new EPIC ID. We created EPIC ID numbers for 69 targets, ranging from 210282492 -- 210282560.</p>

<h2>Features and Events</h2>
<p><strong><em>Not In Fine Point Data</em></strong></p>
<p>The second half of the C0 data is more indicative of the quality of data users should expect from K2. The Kepler spacecraft was not in fine point for the first part of C0, causing large photometric scatter. The data quality is much improved in the second half of the campaign, beginning on cadence 89347 after the safe mode, when compared to the first half of the campaign. See the QUALITY flag (bit 16) to determine when the spacecraft was in fine point.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Safe Mode</em></strong></p>
<p>The Kepler Spacecraft was in safe mode between cadences 88198 and 89346. Data is flagged in the QUALITY column with bit 2. The project used this time to fix large attitude errors that were occuring during resaturation events.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Module 7 Failure</em></strong></p>
<p>Prior to the start of C0, on January 21, 2014, the photometer was autonomously powered off by an under voltage fault in the Local Detector Electronics Power Supply. Since that time, module 7 (i.e., channels 17 to 20) has yielded no star data or charge injection signal. The subsequent behavior of this module is very similar to that of module 3 after it failed on January 19, 2010. K2 continues to operate and collect simultaneous data from sources falling upon the remaining 19 detector modules over 105 square degrees. There is no indication of any accelerated degradation on these other modules.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Large Pixel Masks</em></strong></p>
<p>When planning C0 observations, the pointing performance of K2 was not accurately known. The worst case scenario was that a star at the edge of the focal plane could move as much as 40" from its nominal position. Therefore each star was assigned a large pixel mask by first computing a Kepler-style optimal aperture and then adding 10 rings of pixels to account for a potential 40" pointing offset. During the second half of C0, the pointing performance was excellent and the pointing drifts were no more than 6" for any target star. Care will be needed when performing photometry on C0 data. Simply including all collected pixels for a given target will not create a high signal-to-noise light curve. For tools to help choose your photometric aperture, see for example, <a href="http://keplergo.arc.nasa.gov/PyKE.shtml">PyKE contributed software</a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Jupiter's Reflection</em></strong></p>
<p>Because K2 points along the ecliptic, its field of view will occasionally contain bright solar system objects. Jupiter was in the K2 field of view during C0 from 2014-03-14 through 2014-05-12, but fell on dead module 3. It creates a bright antipodal ghost on module 23, channel 79, and impacts all the targets observed in this region. See the FFI ktwo2014074233223-c00, extension 79, for an image of the reflection.</p>
<p>While Jupiter was on the focal plane, the background level was increased over its nominal value for nearly half the channels, with the largest impact seen in channels 53 -- 84. In addition, as Jupiter moved on and off the focal plane, a specular reflection lasting approximately 6 hours was seen in these channels. The relative background levels as measured in the smear signal from channel 83 are shown below as Jupiter enters the focal plane (near cadence no. 87525) and leaves the focal plane (cadence no. 90375). The specular bump resulted in an increase in background level of 25-30% for the affected channels, while the quasi-static background increase for the time Jupiter was on the focal plane was 3-5%.</p>

<p><strong><em>Observations of M35 and NGC 2158</em></strong></p>
<p>The open clusters M35 (NGC 2168) and NGC 2158 were observed during this campaign by placing 154 separate 50x50 pixel masks over the densest portion of these two adjacent clusters. Each mask was given a custom aperture number to act as the unique identifier found in the file name.

<h2>Data Quality and Processing Notes</h2>
<p><strong><em>Photometric Jitter Caused by Lower Bandwidth</em></strong></p>
<p>During the development of the K2 Mission, the number of guide stars per fine-guidance sensor (FGS) was changed from ten (for Kepler) to one (for K2). This change was demanded by the need for increased aperture sizes given the uncertainties in the star-tracker to boresight alignment and the need to acquire an entirely new field-of-view every 80 to 90 days. To compensate for the increased sensor noise and assure that fine-point lock could be achieved, the attitude control bandwidth was decreased from 0.1 Hz (for Kepler) to 0.02 Hz (for K2). This change in bandwidth means that the cross-boresight attitude (i.e., RA and Dec) has a time constant of 50 seconds, comparable to the short-cadence duration. Engineering studies have shown that the photometric precision of the long-cadence data is also compromised by the larger pointing jitter associated with the lower bandwidth. The project has approved a change in bandwidth to 0.05 Hz (20 seconds) starting with Campaign 3.</p>

<p><strong><em>Channel 10 Black Correction</em></strong></p>
<p>The black correction on Channel 10, mod.out 4.2, has problems because a bright star bleeds into the black region. For data release 1, the affected regions of the black are excluded from the fit of the black, so the fit is poorly constrained and we see chatter in the residuals. This mostly affects stars in the last 200 rows of the channel.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><em>Image Artifacts in K2</em></strong></p>
<p>The thermal environment is changing more rapidly in K2 than it did for the Kepler Mission. As a result the number of channels with significant rolling band (changes in the black level that are both time and spatial dependent) is larger for K2. The channels observed to be most impacted by rolling band in C0 are 1, 2, 10, 11, 14, 25-28, 36, 44, 58, 62, 74 and 79. Other known image artifacts, such as Moiré patterns and undershoot from bright stars, are also likely to be enhanced in K2 data as compared to Kepler. See the <a href="http://archtest.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/KSCI-19033-001.pdf">Kepler Instrument Handbook</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Thruster Firing Flags</em></strong></p>
<p>Since the thruster firing flags are not populated in FITS quality flags for the
C0 Type-1 TPFs, they are delivered as separate
long-cadence <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/thruster_firings/thruster_firing_flags_c0_lc.csv">(thruster_firing_flags_c0_lc.csv)</a>
and short-cadence <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/thruster_firings/thruster_firing_flags_c0_sc.csv">(thruster_firing_flags_c0_sc.csv)</a>
thruster firing tables for the C0 campaign.</p>
