<h3 id="orbit">Orbit</h3>
<p>Kepler is in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit, which insured a
thermally stable environment and provided the ability to remain on a
single pointing for the duration of the prime Kepler
mission. Quarterly rolls were performed – one roll every 93 days – to
reorient the solar arrays. With each roll, the stars in the field of
view land on different regions of the detector relative to their
pre-roll position, introducing quarterly discontinuities in the light
curves. In the K2 mission, the spacecraft is rotated and different fields are observed every ~80 days
in order to prevent sunlight from entering the telescope.</p>
<h3 id="field-of-view">Field of view</h3>
<p>The Kepler photometer consists of 21 CCD modules (each with two 2200x1024
pixel CCDs).  Each module covers 5 square degrees on the sky.  The full 116
square degree field of view on the sky is illustrated below,
specifically for the single field that was observed during the prime
Kepler mission.  Tables that contain the corners of each Kepler CCD
module are available for download (<a href="data/morc_2_ra_dec_4_seasons.txt">ascii</a> and <a href="data/morc_2_ra_dec_4_seasons.xls">Microsoft Excel</a>).
Corners are provided in J2000 celestial coordinates for all four seasonal roll rotations.</p>

<h3 id="instrument-response">Instrument response</h3>
<p>The Kepler spacecraft hosts 0.95-m aperture Schmidt telescope.  The primary instrument aboard Kepler is the focal plane array
consisting of 21 science and 4 Fine Guidance Sensor CCD modules. Field
flattener lenses on each module map the spherical telescope image
surface onto the flat CCD chips, and define the overall wavelength
bandpass. Each science module is an array of 2200x2048
pixels. These 21 modules each have 4 output channels, for a total of
84 channels and 94.6 million active pixels that view the sky, with
additional masked real pixels and virtual pixels for collection of
collateral data.  As of August 2016, three of the modules are no longer in
working order.</p>

<p>The Kepler focal plane detectors and the optical elements within the
Kepler telescope are illustrated above (from the <a href="data/documentation/KSCI-19033-001.pdf">Kepler Instrument Handbook</a>).</p>
<p>The Kepler photometer utilizes one broad bandpass, ranging from 420
to 900 nm. Tables containing the Kepler instrument
response curve in <a href="data/kepler_response_hires1.txt">hi-res</a> and
<a href="data/kepler_response_lowres1.txt">low-res</a> tabulations are available
for download. The shape of the bandpass, shown below, was chosen to contain most
of the optical spectrum. This response curve was
derived during pre-flight testing and
represents the laboratory calibration of the Kepler photometer. </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>The below plot shows the optical element components of the Kepler Instrument Response compared
to approximate M5 and G2 stellar spectra. The total photometer spectral response is a combination of the
transmission functions of all optical elements, including the Schmidt
corrector, the primary mirror assembly, the field flatterner lenses on
each CCD module, and the wavelength dependent quantum efficiency of
the detectors. The front surfaces of the field flatteners are
anti-reflection coated; a bandpass filter coating was applied to the
back surfaces. At long wavelengths the coating was designed to minimize
fringing.</p>

<p>The figure below shows a comparison of the Kepler, MOST, CoRoT and Johnson response
curves (kindly provided by Jason Rowe and extracted from
2009IAUS..253..121R). The transmission functions for the Johnson B,V,R,I
filters have been scaled to peak at 100% transmission. The
spectrum for an A2V star is shown in cyan, which peaks in the UV and
the spectrum for a M2V star is shown in orange which peaks in the
infrared. The two spectra have been scaled to have equal flux in the
Johnson V filter.</p>

<h3 id="pixel-response-function">Pixel response function</h3>
<p>Kepler has an image scale of 3.98 arcseconds per pixel and a pixel
size of 27 × 27 microns.</p>
<p>The design requirements for Kepler emphasize photometric stability
and minimizing noise sources. Users should recognize that
the optimum focal plane geometry for flux collection will not in
principle provide the most compact point spread function, as is
usually desired for imaging experiments. </p>
<p>The Kepler point spread function varies considerably across the focal
plane due primarily to the Schmidt optics, which provide a large FOV
approximately 16° in diameter. The Project quantifies the total
response of the instrument to incident light in terms of its pixel
response function (PRF), which represents the observed appearance of point
sources. The PRF is a combination of the optical design, focus
setting, CCD detector mechanical and electronic properties, and the
temporal sequence of spacecraft pointing stability during an
observation. Not only does the PRF depend on location within the
focal plane, as defined by a source's CCD channel, row and column
location, but also depends on the intrapixel location of the source
centroid (peak incident light). A detailed summary of the
characteristics and modeling of the PRF is provided by <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...713L..97B">Bryson et al.
(2010)</a>.</p>
<p>Users should note that light curves are produced using optimal aperture photometry in the
 PA module via straightforward addition of the flux within the optimal source aperture. No PRF-fitting is involved in this photometry, but
  each source's optimal aperture is defined by the interpolated PRF at
  the source location, coupled with the source brightness and a model
  of the background.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution on the focal plane</strong></p>
<p>Concentrating light in the brightest pixel will degrade the resulting
photometry by increasing sensitivity to image motion, and constrain
the ability to determine image centroids. Conversely, a too-broad PRF
will include additional background flux and noise, reducing the
signal-to-noise ratio of the source. Therefore, the optimal pixel
response function for Kepler science operations was carefully designed
to maximize photometric stability. The Project uses these metrics to
quantify the PRF: the brightest pixel flux fraction (BPFF) and the 95%
encircled energy diameter (EE95), evaluated for the spectrum of a G2V
star. Level 1 requirements are: BPFF should be &lt; 60%; the EE95 is
required to be &lt; 7.0 pixels.</p>
<p>During the commissioning period for Kepler, the focus was adjusted, and the
resulting PRFs measured, using a large set of test stars. Shown below is a representation of the PRF at two locations in the focal
plane. On the left: a PRF from near the edge; on the right: a PRF near
the center. The pixelated image is shown below and a contoured version
above. (Adapted from <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...713L..97B">Bryson et al.
(2010)</a>).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="images/bryson_prfs1.jpg" style="min-width:97%;"/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For K2, image quality continues to vary with position in the focal plane, with the 95% encircled energy diameter ranging from 3.1 to 7.5 pixels and a median of 4.2 pixels. The percentage of point-source flux concentrated in the center pixel is between 20% and 62%, with a median value of 45%.</p>
<p><strong>Vignetting</strong></p>
<p>Vignetting affects the PRF at increasing
distance from the center of the FOV, a consequence of the Schmidt
optical design and large FOV. Somewhat less than half of the active
FOV is unvignetted, and another ~30% is affected, but considered
usable. Vignetting is negligible within 4.6° of the center, and
increases to ~11% at the edge of the FOV at 6.94 degrees off-axis. The
area of sky which is vignetted &lt; 11% is 151.2 square degrees, and the
sky area imaged onto active pixels with &lt; 11% vignetting is 101 square
degrees since there are gaps between modules, a gap between the two
CCDs on each module, and inactive areas on each CCD. </p>
<h3 id="backgrounds">Backgrounds</h3>
<p>Source photometry is affected by both celestial and instrumental
backgrounds. During nominal science data collection, pixels designated
as background are measured in addition to target pixels. These data
are used to correct the photometry within the Photometric Analysis (PA)
pipeline module. For Kepler, a separate set
of background apertures are collected across the focal plane, and a
background measure is derived from these pixels. Users should note that the
pipeline does not use pixels within the source aperture to measure the
local background.</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong></p>
<p>Celestial backgrounds arise from a number of sources, both from
spatially smooth, diffuse light which affects all pixels in the
aperture, and from transient events, which affect a few pixels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zodiacal light, produced by sunlight scattered from dust in the
ecliptic plane.</li>
<li>Diffuse scattered starlight, produced by dust in the Galaxy. In the
  fixed field of view for the
  Kepler mission, the Galactic component shows a spatial gradient,
  increasing at lower Galactic latitudes. </li>
<li>Unresolved starlight. Given the 4x4 arcsec dimensions of the
  pixels, some light in the aperture arises from faint field stars. As
  with the diffuse Galactic emission, the contribution from unresolved
  starlight increases with decreasing Galactic latitude. </li>
<li>Cosmic ray impacts which corrupt individual pixels. The pipeline
   flags and removes cosmic ray events from the pixel counts,
  within the PA pipeline module. Each cosmic ray event is
  replaced with a temporally local average of the pixel's time series
  without the cosmic ray pixel events. </li>
<li>Surrounding sources, i.e. the residual wings of the PSFs produced by nearby
  stars which may overlap the PSF of the target. A correction for contaminating flux in the source aperture
  produced by surrounding sources is applied within the PDC pipeline module - a single valued subtraction, termed the crowding metric. In
  ideal situations the PSFs of neighboring stellar sources would not
  change over time, expect for possible intrinsic source
  variabilty. Observers should be aware that spacecraft operations may
  induce changes in the source PSFs, through focus changes, and
  spacecraft motions (jitter and drift). Motion of the source center
  during an observing season, even at the millipixel level, will
  induce variations in the contaminating flux, introducing small
  levels of noise into the light curve. <br/></li>
</ul>
<p>Instrumental backgrounds include the detector bias level (also termed
black level), which is removed in the CAL pipeline module, scattered light, unexpected electronic
issues discovered during pre-flight characterization of the detectors,
and some features seen during early flight operations,
e.g., "Argabrightening", an anomalous full-field illumination. Spatially varying backgrounds produced by the detector
electronics are fully described in the <a href="data/documentation/KSCI-19033-001.pdf">Kepler Instrument Handbook</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Measurement and removal</strong></p>
<p>Kepler constructs a background flux map using a set of target pixels
specifically assigned for this purpose. Background "targets" are small
(nominally 2 x 2 pixels) postage stamp images which measure the
background signal in the long cadence observations. Since backgrounds
must be estimated and removed from all observed sources in the FOV, a
method was adopted to interpolate background values from all targets
pixels in a channel using the background apertures in that channel. A
maximum of 1125 background apertures and 4,500 pixels (~4 pixels per
target) are allocated for each of the 84 output channels. These
background targets are selected to optimize a 2D polynomial
representation of the background flux distribution, derived separately
for each channel.</p>
<p>For robust fitting, background apertures should be uniformly
distributed on each CCD array. To mitigate edge effects, more
background apertures are positioned at the frame edges. During target
management, background pixels are selected,
avoiding stars and locations affected by charge bleeds.</p>
<p>Background pixels are calibrated in the same manner as source pixels
in the CAL pipeline module. Background channel maps are generated in
PA; interpolated background values are then subtracted from the pixel
values prior to aperture photometry.</p>
<p>A measure of the celestial background in the Kepler FOV is provided in
the Kepler data release notes. The figure below shows the
background flux time series for the Q0+Q1 observing season, derived
from the reprocessed data released on 2010 June 15. The curves show
average over all mod.outs (CCD channels), the modules furthest from
(mod.out 2.4 = channel 4) and nearest to (mod.out 24.4 = channel 84)
the Galactic plane. The vertical offset is produced by the
spatially-dependent Galactic emission; the horizontal trend is caused
by variation in the zodiacal light. The narrow spikes visible in all 3
curves are Argabrightening events. From this plot, a few items are
evident:</p>
<ul>
<li>The temporal and FOV-averaged value background value is ~2.7 × 10−5
  electrons per cadence. This value corresponds to the expected signal
  from a star with Kp ~ 18.3.</li>
<li>The difference in background counts produced by viewing
perpendicular to the Galactic plane is about a factor of 1.8.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="images/kepler_background_Q0+1.jpg" style="min-width:97%;"/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The treatment of the background by the pipeline for
crowded sources may not be optimal. Users should inspect the FOV around sources using a Kepler full-frame
image to check for nearby bright sources which may affect a target. Also note saturated stars in
the same (+/-1) column to check for charge
bleeds.  Users may wish to contruct their own background estimates
using the background pixel files available on the data archive at MAST.</p>
<h3 id="signal-to-noise">Signal-to-noise</h3>
<p>The following plot below demonstrates the fine-point photometric precision achieved by K2 in Campaign 3 (orange) compared to
Kepler in Quarter 10 (blue) [credit: Andrew Vanderburg, created using the method described in
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1412.1827V">Vanderburg (2014)</a>
and
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PASP..126..948V">Vanderburg &amp; Johnson (2014)</a>]. Giant
stars were excluded from the computation of the combined differential
photometric precision (CDPP) to provide a comparison against
photometrically-quiet dwarf stars.  Note that the data from Campaign 3
was taken after applying an increase in pointing control bandwidth, so
data in earlier K2 Campaigns will provide slightly poorer photometric precision.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="images/k2-kpcdpp-201508.png" style="min-width:97%;"/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The limiting factor for observations of faint sources is set by source
confusion, rather than the photometric accuracy computed for isolated
sources. Users wanting to observe objects with Kepler magnitudes fainter
than 17.0 should carefully examine the field around their source and
estimate the contamination from the PSFs of surrounding objects. Note
that an estimate of the crowding metric is provided for most sources
brighter than Kp = 17.0 in the data archive at MAST (under the
field labeled "Contamination"). Contamination is defined as (1 - crowding_value), where the
crowding value was derived when the target catalogs were created. A value of 0 implies no contamination, 1 implies essentially
all background, i.e., complete contamination of the source by
surrounding objects. For fainter sources, observers can estimate the
contamination using imagery from databases like the Digital Sky Survey
or <a href="data-access.html#keplerukirt">UKIRT</a>, supplemented
with the Kepler or K2 Full Frame Images (FFIs) as the latter become
available.</p>
<p>For bright sources, the observed signal in the central pixel(s) will
increase linearly until the well depth is reached. Beyond that level,
charge will bleed into adjacent pixels in the column containing that
source. However, even when the central pixel is saturated, the target
aperture can extend along the bleed column, preserving most or all of
the signal from the source. </p>
<h3 id="flux-calibration">Flux calibration</h3>
<p>Each target observed by Kepler or K2 had or has a pre-set observing aperture uploaded to the
spacecraft. These apertures are defined in terms of the number of
pixels and shape of the array. The brighter a source, the larger the
aperture needed to collect the photons for an optimal detection of
that source. Aperture size is primarily defined by the source's Kepler
magnitude (Kp), a measure of the source intensity as observed through
the wide Kepler bandpass.</p>
<p>The Kepler Science Team conducted an extensive observing program
  prior to launch in order to classify stars in the FOV. The
  fundamental goal was to develop a list of FGKM dwarf stars as the
  primary source list for exoplanet detection. Objects were observed
  in the SDSS griz bands. This photometry, along with 2MASS data form
  the basis of the Kepler Input Catalog.  The Project constructed a set of stellar spectral
  synthesis models covering a range of effective temperature, gravity
  and mean abundance, and derived g,r,i,Kp magnitudes by convolving
  the filter response functions with the models. Using correlations
  between these values, Kepler magnitudes are estimated from the
  observed SDSS magnitudes using empirical formulae.</p>
<p>An approximate
  estimate of Kp can be derived using the following expression, which
  is based on the empirical relations used by the Kepler Stellar
  Classification Program. A user can convert B,V into
SDSS g,r using the transformation derived by Smith et al. (2002 ApJ 123,
2121, Table 7), shown in line 1 and 2 below.  If SDSS g,r values are available, the conditional
statements in line 3 and 4 below can be used.</p>
<p>(1) g   =   0.54 B   +   0.46 V   −   0.07 <br/>
(2) r   =   −0.44 B   +   1.44 V   +   0.12 <br/> 
(3) if   ( g − r )   ≤   0.8    then    Kp   =   0.2 g   +   0.8 r <br/>
(4) if   ( g − r )   &gt;   0.8     then    Kp   =   0.1 g   +   0.9 r <br/></p>
<p>This expression is accurate to about ±0.2 mag for stars hotter than
3500 K. For M stars, users are cautioned that systematic errors may
exceed 0.6 mag, i.e. Kp returns magnitudes that are too
faint.</p>
<p>Given a calibration of (B−V) color with spectral type (effective
temperature), a Kepler magnitude can be estimated. Values for (Kp−V)
are presented below for main-sequence stars, based on the above
relation. This color can be applied to stars whose apparent Johnson V
magnitude is known to obtain Kp, with the caveat that for stars cooler
than M0, the estimated Kp may be too faint.</p>

<h3 id="astrometry">Astrometry</h3>
<p>Source coordinates are provided by the Kepler Input Catalog
(KIC) or the Eplictic Plane Input Catalog (EPIC) for K2. Astrometric calibration of
the source centroids occurs in the PA pipeline
module. Precise centroids of sources within the target aperture
permits correction of the photometry for spacecraft motions during the
observing season.</p>
<p>The focal plane array contains significant gaps between the detectors,
designed to exclude very bright stars from falling into photo-active
pixels (for the Kepler mission).  These gaps will cause some sources,
which appear to lie on the FOV, to actually be not observable. K2 observers should carefully check to see if their
proposed sources land on active silicon using the <a href="software.html#k2fov">K2fov tool</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Source astrometry</strong></p>
<p>The source of the astrometry depends on which
catalog (or catalogs) contain data for that source.  Those catalogs are listed here, with an estimate
of their positional accuracy.  Additional information can be found in
the documentation for the KIC and the EPIC.</p>
<ol>
<li>Kepler Stellar Classification Program; 50 milliarcseconds, data obtained closer to the Kepler epoch, minimizing proper motion offsets </li>
<li>Hipparcos; 10 milliarcseconds </li>
<li>Tycho-2; for V brighter than 8.0; 20 milliarcseconds </li>
<li>UCAC2; 40 milliarcseconds </li>
<li>2MASS; 70 milliarcseconds </li>
<li>USNO-B1.0; 200 milliarcseconds</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Observed astrometry</strong></p>
<p>Image centroids are calculated as part
of the calibration pipeline, within the PA pipeline module. PA computes flux-weighted mean centroids for all stars, which
are tabulated in the light curve files, expressed as row and column
pixels values. These data provide an image centroid time series, and
enable observers to assess target placement during the observing
sequence. On each channel, a set of bright (but not saturated),
relatively isolated stars are chosen to provide a reference grid for
astrometry. Photometry for this set of reference stars is processed
within the Photometer Performance Assessment (PPA) pipeline module to
provide metrics of the photometric and astrometric stability of the
instrument. Image centroids for these stars are used to create a
"plate" solution specific for each CCD channel. This solution is then
interpolated to convert detector coordinates (row, column) to
celestial coordinates (RA, Dec).</p>
<p>The full frame images were designated as engineering data by
the Project, and no astrometric calibration was initally
intended. MAST developed an astrometric solution for the 8 Golden
full-frame images, using the public astrometry.net tool, developed by
Blanton, Hogg, Lang, Mierle &amp; Rowies. These 8 FFIs were taken under
ideal pointing and thermal stability at the start of the mission, and
are available at the data archive at MAST.</p>
<p><strong>Astrometric science with Kepler</strong></p>
<p>The high signal-to-noise ratios achieved with Kepler permit a high
level of astrometric accuracy, despite the large pixel scale and large
field of view. In principle the Kepler data can be used to determine
parallaxes and proper motion for tens of thousands of stars, and
explore more subtle motions, hinting at planetary companions. Based on
analysis of the Kepler Q0+Q1 data, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010arXiv1001.0305M">Monet et al. (2010)</a> provide an estimate of Kepler's
astrometric precision of ~4 milliarcseconds over a single 30 minute
observation (1 long cadence).</p>
