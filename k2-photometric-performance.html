<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Kepler is in a heliocentric orbit, which insures a thermally stable 
environment and provides the ability to remain on a single pointing for the
duration of each Campaign. 
Pointing is maintained by a combination of two reaction wheels and thrusters, 
reacting to motion data provided by fine guidance sensors 
(fine-point observing) or star trackers (coarse-point observing). </p>
<p>With only two remaining reaction wheels, 
these operations are only possible while pointing within 
the orbital plane of the spacecraft, which approximates to the ecliptic. 
Only this specific family of pointings yields operational configurations 
where solar pressure is largely mitigated by spacecraft geometry, 
thereby making viable precision pointing and photometry 
approaching the quality for the Kepler mission. </p>
<p>It is anticipated that K2 will achieve a benchmark photometric precision 
on an m<sub>V</sub> = 12 G2V star of 170 parts-per-million (ppm) 
in 30 minutes of integration, i.e., one long cadence exposure. 
This corresponds to ~50 ppm over a 6.5-hour transit 
of an Earth-sized body around that star.</p>
<p>While stars brighter than m<sub>V</sub> = 11.5 will saturate some pixels, 
K2 performs well on stars as bright as m<sub>V</sub> = 4, 
provided the scientific benefit justifies the large number of pixels 
needed to capture saturated flux bleeding along CCD columns. 
Kepler also has many faint-target scientific applications 
where m<sub>V</sub> = 20 objects yield a photometric precision 
of 10% over 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The broad photometric bandpass has a half-maximum transmission range 
of 430 to 840 nm. 
The instrument has neither changeable filters, 
dispersing elements, nor a shutter. 
The detector has a pixel scale of 3.98 arcseconds. 
Image quality varies with position in the focal plane, 
with the 95% encircled energy diameter ranging from 3.1 to 7.5 pixels, 
with a median of 4.2 pixels. 
The percentage of point-source flux concentrated in the center pixel 
is between 20% and 62%, with a median value of 45%.</p>
<h2 id="data-products">Data products</h2>
<p>Constraints imposed by onboard storage and communications 
dictate that at most 6% of the data from the full focal plane 
are saved and downloaded. 
Instead, data for specific, predetermined targets are saved 
and transmitted as subimages with a typical area of 160 pixels, 
depending on source brightness. 
The brighter a target, the more pixels are required to capture it. 
Image size can be tailored further to accommodate 
extended or very bright, saturated objects. </p>
<p>The Kepler Science Center derives pixel masks for those targets 
successfully justified by proposers and upload these targets 
to the spacecraft before each Campaign. </p>
<p>All observations are taken at one of two temporal resolution settings: 
long (30-minute) or short (1-minute) cadence. 
It is expected that on the order of 10,000 long cadence targets 
will be available per Campaign, and on the order of 50 short cadence targets. 
Extended or bright objects requiring larger aperture sizes 
decrease the total number of targets available 
and must be justified carefully.</p>
<p>Data distribution and archival services are performed 
by the Space Telescope Science Institute’s 
<a href="https://archive.stsci.edu">MAST archive</a>. 
Final data products available to observers 
include original and calibrated pixel values 
and light curves for each individual target. 
The calibration corrects for bias level, smear, galactic cosmic rays, 
flat fielding, dark current, background, and instrument noise. 
Simple aperture photometry will be used to generate light curves. </p>
<p>Data is delivered tin Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format. 
A thorough understanding of the noise sources and systematic errors of K2 
is needed by observers in order to generate their own light curves 
from the original (uncalibrated or calibrated) pixel data 
or interpret structure found in archived light curves. 
There is no exclusive use period associated with any K2 data.</p>
<h2 id="photometric-performance">Photometric performance</h2>
<p>The photometric precision is dependent primarily 
upon motion of the spacecraft boresight on jitter timescales 
shorter than an exposure length 
and solar-induced drift timescales longer than an exposure. </p>
<h3 id="reaction-wheel-jitter">Reaction wheel jitter</h3>
<p>During engineering tests between Oct-Dec 2013, 
the spacecraft collected data in a coarse-point mode. 
The measured Full-Width Half Maximum of the coarse-point 
K2 Point-Spread Function is a measure of spacecraft jitter 
and is within 5% of the fine-point Kepler Point-Spread Function 
across the entire field-of-view. </p>
<p>The figure below provides a fit of the Kepler fine-point Point-Spread Function to a K2 coarse-point target close to the spacecraft boresight. 
From top-left to bottom-right: a 30 min observation of a 12th magnitude K2 star, the best-fitting Kepler PSF model, the best-fit model binned over detector pixels, and the fit residual. Spacecraft jitter during two-wheel operation is therefore generally only a few percent larger than the three-wheel Kepler mission and is not a major concern for K2 photometric precision. </p>

<h3 id="solar-pressure-induced-drift">Solar pressure-induced drift</h3>
<p>Low-frequency motion due to solar pressure and subsequent thruster firings causes targets to drift across detector pixels and is the dominant factor in photometric precision after photon statistics. The frequency of reaction wheel momentum resaturations and thruster-controlled pointing tweaks will be tuned to trade photometric precision with pixel mask size and fuel consumption. During the Dec 2013 test, resaturations occurred on a 48-hour cycle and pointing tweaks every 12 hours. Thruster firings kept targets localized to within three pixels across the duration of the 6-day test run. For the purposes of providing a photometric precision measure that can be compared with the Kepler mission, an uncrowded 12th magnitude target is selected for showcasing and its sensitivity to a 6-hour duration planet transit is measured. After defining a pixel mask to contain the 3-pixel focal-plane drift of the target, motion systematics and stellar astrophysics are removed from the subsequently derived Simple Aperture Photometry time series with a 48-hour Savitzky-Golay filter (a standard method to prepare stellar light curves for transit searches). The subsequent median 6-hr photometric precision of a 12th mag target is 87 ppm (94 µmag). This is within a factor 4 of the fine-point Kepler mission precision for quiet G dwarfs. The blue shaded regions represent times associated with reaction wheel resaturations and engineering tests. The data collected during these intervals were clipped from the time-series. </p>
<p><a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/images/Dec2013SAP.png"><img src="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/images/Dec2013SAP.png" style="max-width: 640px;"/></a></p>
<p>A major activity during ongoing testing is the measurement of thermal alignment changes between star trackers and boresight throughout a campaign. This calibration will allow more precise pointing control, smaller pixel masks and consequently more targets per campaign. There remains room for further improvements in photometric precision by optimizing the frequency of pointing resets and acquiring guide stars for fine-guidance tracking. These capabilities are being tested and optimized in early 2014 before science operations begin. Nevertheless, the photometric capabilities already attained in coarse point provide the community with a powerful scientific observatory.</p>
<h3 id="fine-point-photometric-precision">Fine-point photometric precision</h3>
<p>Fine-point operations were achieved and maintained during the Feb 2014 engineering test. The plot below compares a 12th magnitude target observed during the Dec 2013 coarse-point operations (left) with a 12th magnitude target collected in fine-point (right). The spacecraft pointed in different directions for these two tests and therefore this is a not a like-for-like comparison - the nature and intrinsic variability of both targets is unknown. Nevertheless, in this example, fine-point increases the photometric precision relative to coarse-point by a factor 2. In both plots, the blue curve is 30-min cadence data, the red diamonds are the same data, binned to 6 hours. The dashed line represents the 1-σ standard deviation of the 30-min data. The median 6-hr photometric precision of the 12th magnitude coarse-point target is 82 ppm, while the same measure for the fine-point target is 44 ppm.</p>
<p><a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/images/Feb2014SAP.png"><img src="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/images/Feb2014SAP.png" style="max-width: 640px;"/></a></p>
<p>The following plot provides an ensemble comparison of Kepler three-wheel fine-point precision (red), K2 two-wheel coarse-point precision (green) and K2 two-wheel fine-point precision (blue). The red lines are carefully-selected quiet G dwarfs, falling upon arbitrary modules of the Kepler detector. The green points are stars of unknown spectral type and intrinsic variability and therefore the scatter around a power law fit (dashed line) is considerably larger than the Kepler sample. The K2 fine-point ensemble has been extracted from pixels using apertures optimized for signal-to-noise, and systematic, motion-related structure has been calculated and subtracted using singular value deconvolution across the ensemble of light curves. The large scatter demonstrates that the engineering targets display a range of intrinsic astrophysical variability, however the noise floor suggests that K2 fine-point data is a significant improvement upon coarse-point quality and approaches the photometric precision of the Kepler archive. </p>

<p>The series of plots below contain the same 11th magnitude target, observed during the Feb 2014 fine-point observations. In each a Mandel-Agol planet transit model has been injected, assuming the star is solar-size and the planet has an orbital period of 1.5 days. In each curve four transits have therefore been injected over a 9-day time series and folded upon the orbital period. Such Jupiters (top-left), Neptunes (top-right) and Super-Earths (bottom-left) will be readily detected by current planet searching algorithms. The 6-hr 5-σ Earth-like transit depth (bottom-right) will be challenging, just as it is in the Kepler time-series, but will becoming increasingly significant with more recorded transits.</p>
